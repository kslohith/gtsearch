{"paragraph": "Initially known as The Safety Bill of Rights, the Occupational Safety and Health Act passed in December of 1970 as a way of assuring the health and safety of men and women working in hazardous working environments. Soon after, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was founded in April of 1971. According to the Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health, when OSHA was established in the 1970s “women made up less than one percent of workers in the construction trades. By 1995, that percentage had only grown to 2.3%.” As of 2021, women represented 32.5% of the approximately 78,471 Occupational Safety and Health specialists and technicians in the field (Data USA)."},
{"paragraph": "Included in the dramatic increase of women in the Occupational Safety and Health field were Rachel Schneider, Gwendolyn Jordan-Howard, Paige Rohrig, and Vicki Temple. Throughout their careers as safety and health professionals, these women have dedicated themselves to enhancing their knowledge and skills through continued education, either as learners or instructors with Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE). Each of these women joined the field at different times and for different reasons, yet all share a common commitment to making a difference and saving lives."},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": "After taking an environmental health course in college, Rachel Schneider knew she wanted a career where she could explore the relationship between different environments and the effect they may have on our health. The average person spends approximately one-third of their life at work. Because of this, Rachel saw the opportunity to “help companies ensure their work environment doesn’t negatively affect their employees’ health” she said. Rachel started her career in 2017 as an occupational safety consultant with Georgia Tech’s Safety, Health, Environmental Services. Now, her work as a consultant allows her to travel throughout the state of Georgia and make safety improvements to numerous businesses from a variety of industries including food manufacturing and healthcare."},
{"paragraph": "Like most safety and health specialists, Rachel’s passion for keeping workers safe is the driving force pushing her every day. Throughout her career, she has appreciated the increased emphasis on the importance of mental health. This is valuable for all workers, but especially among those in construction where the CDC found the rate of suicide among males to be almost four times higher than the national average. While this isn’t an area she specializes in, it is a great example of the power of a healthy work environment. “Although oftentimes there is no single cause for suicide,” said Rachel, “in the occupational safety and health field, we are expanding the breadth of what defines a healthy workplace and recognizing more and more how both policies and employers can better address workplace stress, mental health, and the prevention of suicide.”"},
{"paragraph": "Rachel also works as an educator with the OSHA Training Institute Education Center at Georgia Tech (GT-OTIEC), one of the 26 national OTIECs in the nation. One thing she appreciates about that role is the ability to affect the safety and health of numerous workers, businesses, and industries. In her courses, Rachel often reminds her students to “dig deeper and keep asking questions\" when incidents happen. This allows them to identify the underlying gaps in the overall safety and health management system."},
{"paragraph": "The GT-OTIEC’s courses offered through GTPE, attract a diverse group of safety and health professionals who can leverage their backgrounds and experiences into discussions everyone present can learn from. Students are known to share the different hazard control methods they have found success in, how they have succeeded in involving their employees in safety and health, and what they have done to create a work environment where workers feel valued and safe."},
{"paragraph": "By sharing their experiences, Rachel’s students aren’t the only ones learning during her courses. “It has been said that the best way to learn a topic is to teach it. I believe that is certainly true! However, not only have I learned the OSHA standards better, but I have also learned (and continue to learn) so much from the students I am teaching,” Rachel shared."},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": "“I can honestly say I can’t see myself doing any other job.” This was Gwendolyn Jordan-Howard’s response when asked why she has spent 30 years and counting working in occupational safety and health. Gwendolyn’s first step toward her 30-year career came after a conversation with two of her cousins about wanting to change majors while an undergrad. The two women, one of whom is a Georgia Tech alumna, were working in nuclear physics and mechanical engineering and recommended Gwendolyn follow her passion for science and look into an environmental health science degree. Three years into her career, Gwendolyn followed in her cousin’s footsteps and began taking OSHA training courses at Georgia Tech."},
{"paragraph": "Gwendolyn took her first course through GTPE in 1997. \"I have not stopped learning from the program since,\" she said. \"The staff such as Dr. Turner, Jenny Houlroyd, and Hilarie Warren have been pivotal in my career, my learning, and my growth as a safety professional. I will always be grateful for their guidance.”"},
{"paragraph": "Today, Gwendolyn is the director of Environmental Health Safety Security at Hoshizaki America. Gwendolyn firmly believes that safety and health is an essential, ever-changing part of all jobs and workplaces, as new challenges constantly arise. Her ultimate goal as an safety and health professional is to help create an environment where workers feel safe mentally and physically. While the idea of ever-changing assignments may sound draining to some, for Gwendolyn, it's the main reason she enjoys the field."},
{"paragraph": "\"Occupational Safety and Health is a science that involves understanding the behaviors of people and building an environment where they feel safe,” Gwendolyn said as she defined the nature of her job. A mentor once told her, occupational safety and health and environmental health science personnel play a critical role throughout the entire lifespan of an organization. As a safety and health professional, Gwendolyn begins protecting workers from the planning stage of every project, making sure safety is a priority. She continues this responsibility until the doors close, all while taking into consideration the mindset of every employee from the start to the finish of the workday."},
{"paragraph": "Understanding the behaviors of humans means understanding human error and its consequences. Twelve years into her career, Gwendolyn faced the intense human emotion of watching an employee’s family suffer the sadness and realization that their loved one nearly lost his life in an incident on the job. This employee was seriously injured and had to fight mentally and physically to get back on his feet. Some might say that’s just part of the job, but for Gwendolyn, it “made me strive to always go above and beyond for safety,” she explained. Her passion for safety doesn’t end with her duties on the job, but also gives her hope that as OSHA evolves, there will be an increased focus on preventing injuries and illnesses in the workplace rather than simply reacting to them."},
{"paragraph": "With 23 years of experience, Paige Rohrig is a senior research scientist with Georgia Tech’s Safety, Health, Environmental Services. Through on-site consultations, she works with employers and employees in a wide range of industries throughout Georgia, providing them with safety and health insights and guidance. When starting her career, Paige’s learning strategy was to learn from the top down. “I had more senior personnel teach me the basics of safety and to think beyond the regulations,” she said. One of the most important things Paige learned from her superiors is “if it looks unsafe, it is,” which opened her eyes to a broader range of safety-related hazards and solutions."},
{"paragraph": "Paige is also a senior research scientist with GT-OTIEC, a natural progression of her job. Being an educator with GT-OTIEC allows Paige to network with safety professionals she may not have come in contact with otherwise. “I love meeting other safety professionals and hearing what they are dealing with day-to-day. I like the networking aspect and learning new ideas and solutions in safety and health,” she said. The networking in these courses isn’t just between Paige and her students though. Students are networking with each other and, in turn, learning from each other. As an instructor, Paige hopes each student leaves her courses having learned at least one new thing and advises her learners to “talk to the other students in the class and try to gain as many resources and knowledge as you can.”"},
{"paragraph": "The depth of Paige's passion for education extends well beyond the classroom. Hilarie Warren, director of GT-OTIEC shared how, over the 18 years they have worked together, she has regularly witnessed Paige's willingness to help and her trained eye for safety solutions. Hilarie shared how impactful she found Paige's willingness to express uncertainty in moments where correct information was paramount."},
{"paragraph": "\"Years ago, I shadowed Paige on a site visit. I remember her responding to a question with 'I don’t know, but I will get back to you after I check a source.' To my recollection, it might have been the first time I’d heard a female colleague admit uncertainty – but it was powerful to me as a young safety and health professional. It demonstrated the importance of being honest and transparent, and then following through to provide the most accurate and thorough answer possible – which of course she did. With a couple of extra resources thrown in for good measure.\""},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": "Vicki Temple, safety director with Civil Cites Services Inc. has 15 years of experience in the occupational safety and health field, but her journey with safety and health is lifelong. When Vicki was a young girl, her father was working as a contractor and was injured in a confined space accident, suffering burns across his body. Due to the severity of his injury, Vicki was unable to hug her father for months following the incident. This tragic accident inspired Vicki’s interest in safety and ultimately led her to a career in safety and health. “I want to do everything I can to prevent injuries and accidents. I enjoy meeting and training people from all walks of life and love knowing that proper training can make the difference in keeping workers safe,” she said."},
{"paragraph": "At the beginning of her career, the field heavily focused on the Progressive Discipline process, a system where workers were written up for their mistakes. Vicki explained, “there was a good chance workers could be terminated based upon the accident.\" In more recent years, the field has shifted to a proactive approach called the Behavior-Based Safety method - a technique focused on identifying and changing the factors that influence unsafe behaviors and using positive reinforcement to encourage safe behaviors."},
{"paragraph": "“I remember when workers were scared to report near misses for fear of being punished, and now, we’re getting to a point where workers understand that those are learning opportunities that need to be shared. Blame rarely leads to improvement, but learning to do things correctly can” Vicki said."},
{"paragraph": "When asked what the best advice she’s received from a mentor has been Vicki shared, “listen first and let them know you care.” Like most of us, Vicki occasionally finds herself in a situation where the solution feels obvious, but through her years of experience, she has learned the importance of different perspectives when searching for solutions. One of those important perspectives is that of OSHA. “OSHA is our partner… not someone to be afraid of on the job site. They exist to keep workers safe” she explained."},
{"paragraph": "Nine years ago, Vicki made the conscious decision - heavily influenced by her continued passion for safety and health training - to return to the workforce after a break to focus on caring for her children. “Each person needs to know that they are important, their decisions matter, and they have ownership in keeping others safe,” Vicki said. As she continues to move forward in her career, Vicki hopes the field will continue its increased scrutiny of the safety processes and systems and the ‘how’ that leads to accidents and injuries so that professionals like herself can learn and improve the systems they use every day to keep workers safe."},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": "Rachel Schneider: Don’t let unfamiliarity with the standards keep you from pursuing a career in this field. I truly believe that a strong desire to ensure workers are protected and healthy is enough for someone to have a successful career."},
{"paragraph": "Gwendolyn Jordan-Howard: Occupational safety and health is a job that challenges your mind, body, and soul to be better, continue to learn, and evolve as the industry and the world change."},
{"paragraph": "Paige Rohrig: This is a great field and you can truly make a difference. I believe working in the safety field does help prevent injuries, illnesses, and fatalities every day."},

{"paragraph": "Jennifer Stanford Johnson welcomes challenges. Being a leader and technologist demands agility, the courage to embrace change, and a willingness to pivot when needed – Johnson employed all three in order to realize her fulfilling career in data and artificial intelligence."},
{"paragraph": "The secret to Johnson’s success stems from her ability to recognize when and how she needs to expand her already impressive skillset. History repeated itself when this Triple Jacket once again found her educational needs led to Georgia Tech."},
{"paragraph": "As a college director of student success, Johnson’s mission was to increase retention and graduation rates for undergraduates. “Tracking matriculation was straightforward, but to truly identify and measure predictors of success and intervene with impactful practices required a deeper dive. I was broadly aware of the great things I could do with the data - but I knew I needed to enhance my skill set.” And when Johnson senses change is needed, she takes action."},
{"paragraph": "She’d done it before. After earning both a Bachelor and a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering at Georgia Tech, Johnson was progressing full speed ahead in her aeronautics career at Lockheed Martin when she knew she needed to make a shift. With two young children at home, “Work-life balance is important to me, and I was not getting enough quality time with my growing family.”"},
{"paragraph": "So, she pivoted her career to match her work-life balance and successfully consulted for six years before accepting a full-time role at Spelman."},
{"paragraph": "Her desire to do more in her position at Spelman led her to search for a data analytics program. “I didn’t have to look very far. Georgia Tech is where I’ve found success in the past. And I’m already a part of the community - that was important to me.”"},
{"paragraph": "Johnson enrolled in the Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMS Analytics) program, which enabled her to explore the college’s data to thoughtfully meet its student success goals. Johnson’s technical skillset soon met an opportunity of a lifetime, and she became an applied intelligence data science executive at Accenture."},
{"paragraph": "Now, this Triple Jacket shares the pivots in both her personal and professional lives."},
{"paragraph": "Q: You were already focusing on data in your work when you decided to pursue an OMSA degree - what made you feel you needed to take that step?"},
{"paragraph": "A: I was working in a space that was heavily data-oriented - creating databases and tracking student success - and I wanted to do so much more with that data. I felt strongly that there were insights to be gained, but I knew that I needed to upskill to maximize the use of the data. I knew there was so much more I was capable of."},
{"paragraph": "Q: It sounds like your desire to dive more deeply into data extended beyond the immediate task at hand in your position at the time, is that so?"},
{"paragraph": "A: I found myself in a higher education role that was very much focused on STEM outreach. The more I engaged in that work, which was very gratifying, I started feeling inauthentic because I was espousing all the reasons why a student should pursue a career in STEM. This realization prompted me to think about how I could change things and get myself back on the STEM path. How could I become more aligned with the type of work that was my true passion?"},
{"paragraph": "Q: With all the higher ed choices you had, why did you decide to return to Georgia Tech for your third degree?"},
{"paragraph": "A: I researched what opportunities there were and that led me to Tech’s OMS Analytics program. When I saw the course curriculum, the faculty engaged in the work, the time to degree, and the alumni feedback, I was certain this was the program for me. My historical knowledge about what it takes to be successful at Georgia Tech was instrumental. Whether online or on campus, Tech is rigorous. I knew I was capable of success given my history at this institution. It has always been the place that's launched me into the next phase of my career, whether that's as an undergraduate going into the workforce for the first time or a graduate student working while raising a family or as a consultant. The Georgia Tech credential has once again changed the course of my career. Georgia Tech has a very special place in my heart."},
{"paragraph": "Q: Did the OMS Analytics program help you achieve the changes you were looking for?"},
{"paragraph": "A: Absolutely. As I began the courses, I was able to apply that learning to my job. There was an immediate value-add. And then the ultimate pivot allowed me to work at Accenture. This may sound corny, but the impact has been life-changing. The decision to enter and complete the program was confidence-building and put me on a path where I can lead teams focused on data analysis, data integrations, AI (inclusive of Gen AI), and predictive modeling initiatives in the health and public services industry. It led me to a dream executive role, all while being engaged in doing meaningful work to help others live healthier, more productive lives. For this, I am grateful every day."},

He had wanted to earn a master’s degree for some time, but his wife’s battle with breast cancer – and beating stage-one melanoma himself – helped shape how he would use the skills he’d gain."},
{"paragraph": "During Erin’s medical scare, Matt learned everything he could about her specific type of cancer and became focused on genomics."},
{"paragraph": "“I convinced Erin’s oncologist to enroll her in a clinical trial for a predictive diagnostic test that uses genetic biomarker data, combined with other patients' demographic, historical health data, and clinical-trial outcome results, to guide systemic therapy in early-stage disease.”"},
{"paragraph": "Through that experience, Matt’s interest in data science began to lean heavily toward a specialization in health care and life sciences. He discovered the OMS Analytics program and became laser focused on making the cut to get in."},
{"paragraph": "“OMS Analytics was, by far, my top choice of programs to get into,” he said."},
{"paragraph": "To Matt’s delight, the program accepted his application for a Spring 2019 start. His first course was ISYE 6501: Introduction to Analytics Modeling, which OMS Analytics Executive Director Joel Sokol teaches."},
{"paragraph": "Everything seemed to be falling into place. Then, the unthinkable happened."},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": "Three days after completing Dr. Sokol’s ISYE 6501 course, Matt nearly lost his life when a Murphy bed he was helping a neighbor install broke loose from the wall. The entire bed, and its framing mechanism, collapsed on Matt’s head."},
{"paragraph": "The blunt-force trauma resulted in a severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and Matt slipped into a coma. Even after a life-sustaining craniotomy and cranioplasty, the prognosis was grim. The effects of Matt’s injury, the medications trying to stabilize him, as well as his immobility and prolonged intubation, began to take its toll on the former triathlete’s body. He experienced seizures, pneumonia, diabetes, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, fever, and infection – all within two weeks."},
{"paragraph": "“Even though Matt was in a coma, I talked to him about the wonderful life we’d built,” Erin recalled. “And I told him repeatedly how he was going to walk across that stage at Georgia Tech and graduate.”"},
{"paragraph": "She hung a Georgia Tech banner in his Intensive Care Unit (ICU) room and played videos of Dr. Sokol that she found online, so Matt could hear his voice."},
{"paragraph": "“The medical field says that the last sense you have is your hearing,” she said, “and because OMS Analytics is an online program, Dr. Sokol’s voice had been a constant in our home. He was the soundtrack of our lives the semester before Matt’s injury.”"},
{"paragraph": "She also told Matt how she’d exchanged emails with Dr. Sokol to inform him about the accident and remove him from the summer course he’d enrolled in. In addition to expressing his concern and support, Dr. Sokol had told her that Matt earned a high grade in his course."},
{"paragraph": "As she recounted the exchange to Matt, she told her high-achieving husband that she had good news and bad news. “The good news is that Dr. Sokol would love for you to be a TA. The bad news is you received the second-highest grade in his class; not the first,” she joked."},
{"paragraph": "Miraculously, almost three weeks after the accident, Matt began to emerge from his coma. The first several days, his eyes were unfocused and vacant of awareness, but despite his primitive brain-stem state, and the counsel Erin was receiving from clinicians, she refused to entertain the possibility of placing him in a facility that didn’t have a strong focus on rehabilitation."},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": "Soon, Erin began petitioning to transport Matt from his St. Petersburg, Fla., hospital to Shepherd Center in Atlanta. As fate would have it, in addition to being world-renowned for treating and rehabilitating patients with brain and spinal cord injuries, the center is less than three miles from Georgia Tech."},
{"paragraph": "Erin’s lobbying paid off and, once there, Matt began improving more quickly than anyone could have imagined. His recovery was still a battle every step of the way; however, his progress was both consistent and remarkable. Working through paralysis of the right side of his body was one of Matt’s biggest difficulties, but within weeks, he was even in the early stages of running again."},
{"paragraph": "Less than 12 weeks after the accident, Matt graduated from Shepherd Center’s post-acute brain injury rehabilitation program called Shepherd Pathways. To Matt’s surprise, Dr. Sokol stopped by to offer well wishes and encouragement. They also discussed Matt becoming a TA for the course he’d completed just before the accident."},
{"paragraph": "“It was a thoughtful gesture and really boosted my confidence,” said Matt."},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": ""},
{"paragraph": "Matt helped with ISYE 6501 that Fall term and audited other courses to gauge if he’d healed enough to be able to re-enter the program. The experience convinced him that he could handle it and he re-enrolled the next academic term."},
{"paragraph": "As he progressed through his courses, few people knew about his recent brain trauma. He preferred it that way but knew a support system was there if he needed it. “I always felt that Georgia Tech had my back,” he said."},
{"paragraph": "Widespread access to internet-connected devices for recreation and work provides lurking cybercriminals the opportunity to exploit more data and information than ever before. Of the 3,000 individuals polled by the National Cybersecurity Alliance and Cybsafe 45% reported they are “always online”. This global connectivity coupled with the use of more advanced and complex tactics by hackers can make both the private and public sectors vulnerable to cyberattacks."},
{"paragraph": "Data breaches and Internet of Things (IoT) malware are among the most frequent attacks. They affect businesses of all sizes and have proven to be common and costly. By April 2023, 340 million people had been affected by data breaches or leaks. Access to data and sensitive information by malicious attackers can result in identity theft, financial loss, or a damaged reputation. According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report, the global average cost of a data breach in 2023 was $4.45 million, a 15% increase since 2020."},
{"paragraph": "As corporations, big and small, seek new ways to increase productivity, vulnerabilities grow. The dramatic spike in remote working and its reliance on digital platforms has only increased the opportunity for hackers to target corporations and individuals alike. As of 2023, ransomware attacks have affected 72% of businesses worldwide, marking an increase from the previous five years, according to Statista. The need for highly trained cybersecurity professionals to identify issues, find effective solutions, and secure valuable data against malicious attackers is more crucial than ever."},
{"paragraph": "Mustaque Ahamad, professor in Georgia Tech's School of Cybersecurity and Privacy and director of the Online Master of Science in Cybersecurity (OMS Cybersecurity) Information Security track, underlines the responsibility all of us bear to stay proactive and alert. “Attackers just need one way to get into our systems,” says Ahamad. “If we do not play our part, we become the way attackers get into our systems and expose an entire organization to online risks.”"},
{"paragraph": "The cost of a cyberattack is not only expensive, but it can also negatively affect systems that are vital to a high-functioning society. Attacks against infrastructure disrupt critical services and can inflict serious damage. The public sector is not the only one that is interconnected. Modern corporations and industries maintain critical infrastructures and cyber-physical control systems that are increasingly connected as well. Examples include Internet-of-Things (IoT), medical devices, power grid, drones, and autonomous cars. “This increased connection,” says Saman Zonouz, associate professor in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy and director of the OMS Cybersecurity Cyber-Physical Systems track “has broadened the attack surface and vulnerabilities in these platforms that are regularly exploited by adversaries across the globe.”"},
{"paragraph": "Cybersecurity and resilience guarantees, predictive detection, proactive response, and recovery countermeasures are needed to improve our critical infrastructure. “The U.S. industry needs practically deployable cybersecurity protection solutions,” says Zonouz. This need “has opened up the job market for cyber-physical security expertise remarkably,” he notes."},
{"paragraph": "Artificial Intelligence’s fast evolution is not only reshaping the economy and workforce, but also generating concern regarding the propagation of disinformation. Brenden Kuerbis, executive director of the Online Master of Science in Cybersecurity, notes that there is a level of overreaction to this threat that can undermine important values such as innovation, freedom of expression, and the global internet. However, he also speaks to the concern over how fast it can generate disinformation across cultural barriers and the challenge this presents. “These tools can mimic human behavior so convincingly that it becomes challenging to distinguish between genuine and fabricated content,” says Kuerbis. “When coupled with dissemination through traditional media outlets and automated social media bots, this becomes a formidable challenge.”"},
{"paragraph": "Finding a solution to this threat requires participation from business leaders, scientific and media experts, and governments. Kuerbis states that technical solutions, information sharing, and policies that provide transparency are ways to address this issue while “preserving the avenues for technological innovation, and safeguarding freedom of expression.”"},
{"paragraph": "Interconnectivity encourages collaboration, fosters healthy competition, and allows industries to generate effective results. It also exposes corporations, governments, and individuals to an unpredictable and ever-evolving digital landscape. However, the emphasis on threats coming from other nations “oversimplifies the cybersecurity problem and diverts our attention from the standards, practices, implementation and monitoring methods that can prevent or detect all cybersecurity threats,” says Milton Mueller, professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Public Policy and director of the OMS Cybersecurity Policy track."},
{"paragraph": "Embracing global connectivity while remaining aware of its vulnerabilities is key as industries adapt to modern technological advancements. The complexity of the digital landscape presents challenges, but its dynamic nature also provides those in the field a rewarding career where you are constantly learning, solving intricate problems, and ultimately making the world a safer place."},

{"paragraph": "If you heard two spouses had each decided to get a Master of Science degree, mid-career, at the same university within months of each other, you would probably think they were on the same career path, pursuing a common goal in a shared field."},
{"paragraph": "However, in the case of Grant and Kimberly Austin, you’d be wrong."},
{"paragraph": "They've approached their careers from different perspectives and developed distinct areas of expertise, one a security advisor with a major corporation and the other a business entrepreneur in IT. While they both started their careers at the same time after receiving their undergraduate degrees, they found themselves at divergent points on their respective paths."},
{"paragraph": "What they did share, in addition to two children, was a desire to take proactive steps in determining the direction of their future professional lives. And that is where two very distinctive Georgia Tech Online Master of Science (OMS) programs came into play."},
{"paragraph": "For Grant, the opportunity to specialize more deeply in his field by obtaining an advanced degree in cybersecurity was the right fit. For Kimberly, the opportunity to pivot into one of the hottest and most versatile fields - data science - aligned with her interests, needs, and strengths."},
{"paragraph": "You were both well-established in your separate career paths. What made you decide to return to college for your master’s degree?"},
{"paragraph": "Grant: I was working as an Information Security and Compliance Advisor at Southeast Toyota Finance when the company began offering a new employee education benefit. I started thinking about what would it be like to go back to school and further my education. At that point, I had been in the cybersecurity field for 10 years, and my career had evolved from the purely technical side to evaluating contracts and proposals, managing privacy compliance, presenting to committees and boards, and explaining risk and cybersecurity to non-cybersecurity people."},
{"paragraph": "Kimberly: Unlike Grant, I wasn’t really thinking about getting a master’s degree. I had sold my IT business in 2020 and was pondering what to do next. I knew I wanted to shift away from the IT support work I had done previously and focus on something with numbers. I mean, I make spreadsheets for recreation! So, I was ready for a complete career change."},
{"paragraph": "It can be challenging to have one parent pursuing a master's while raising children. What was it like when you were both doing it at the same time?"},
{"paragraph": "Grant: We had to coordinate things between us and our kids so that we could be available when needed, but I will admit it wasn’t easy."},
{"paragraph": "Kimberly: There have been a lot of compromises while we were both enrolled and raising two children. We’ve relied on more prepared foods and quick meals. We also try to attend every home football game where my daughter performs with her marching band. Sometimes that entailed doing homework in the stands!"},
{"paragraph": "What made you each decide to pursue a master’s degree from Georgia Tech?"},
{"paragraph": "Grant: I researched a number of cybersecurity master’s programs and knew Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Cybersecurity (OMS Cybersecurity) was the one for me. I applied, was accepted, and never looked back. I took one class per term while I continued working full-time and graduated from the program in May 2023. Three months later, I was offered a promotion by my employer who noted my recent degree as part of their decision."},
{"paragraph": "Kimberly: For me, Grant, who was already enrolled in the OMS Cybersecurity program suggested I might like data analytics. The more I looked at it, the more enthralled I became. Seeing Grant apply what he was learning in real time to his career sealed the deal for me. I knew Grant was gaining knowledge that was directly relevant to his career, so that gave me the confidence that an analytics degree would provide a strong foundation for me to pivot my career. I applied to the Georgia Tech Online Master in Analytics (OMS Analytics) program, and soon we were both grad students at Tech. I am scheduled to graduate in December 2023 and have been working as a Senior Analyst at World Market since June 2023."},
{"paragraph": "You each had different goals when you started the program, and you seemed to have achieved them even faster than you had hoped for, with a promotion shortly after graduating for you, Grant, and a job in a new field while still enrolled for you, Kimberly. What were your goals when you started your respective degree programs?"},
{"paragraph": "Grant: “My goal was to be a director of cyber risk management or director of privacy within five years. [And within months], I’ll be the Director of Business Information Security for an automotive finance business unit. They knew I had the experience and skills to fit the role, and the master’s degree showed that I was dedicated to expanding my knowledge and growing my career in cybersecurity.”"},
{"paragraph": "Kimberly: “I started getting interviews for analyst positions about halfway through the program. A master’s degree from Georgia Tech provided proof to potential employers that I was capable of doing analytics work, even though it was not readily apparent from my previous job history."},
{"paragraph": "Applying what you learn in class directly to your job is a common theme with the Online Master of Science degree programs. Did you find that to be true in your cases?"},
{"paragraph": "Grant: The analysis I did in my OMS Cybersecurity practicum project was directly applicable to my employer’s businesses. The education on privacy compliance in the Privacy for Professionals class was specifically relevant and impactful."},
{"paragraph": "Kimberly: Definitely. From my courses, I learned which metrics are key to report on. I also learned coding logic and best practices from the program that I use in my current job. I’m looking forward to applying the skills I've learned in my upcoming practicum with my employer, combining Python and SQL coding skills with analytics knowledge to develop a model that will directly benefit my company."},
{"paragraph": "Overall, what would you say about Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science programs?"},
{"paragraph": "Grant: There is not another master’s program that compares to the quality of education or the value of the investment."},
{"paragraph": "Kimberly: Since I grew up in Georgia, Georgia Tech has always been the pinnacle university for technical education. I was excited to find a program that aligned with my career pivot. It has been a lot of hard work, but worth every bit of the effort."},

{"paragraph": "In the eerie world of cyberspace, today's cybercriminals have evolved into stealthy and sinister adversaries. Much like digital Hannibal Lecters, they savor our data with fava beans and a nice chianti, leaving us to fend off their insatiable appetite for your information. While the valiant cybersecurity professionals are busy defending companies, entire industries, and even national power grids, there are several tricks you can use to ward off lurking threats and creep your online activity shrouded in secrecy."},
{"paragraph": "As you embrace the brightest and shiniest new electronics, don’t forget about your old ones as you transfer your usage. Before you bid them farewell, perform a factory reset to cleanse them of your data. The last thing you want is to unwittingly pass on a device filled with your digital ghosts, even if it is just going back to the manufacturer."},
{"paragraph": "Keeping your data safe with the 3-2-1 data backup strategy is much like wielding a wooden stake. You hope you'll never have to use it, but you’ll be happy to have it should the need ever arise. Make sure to have 3 copies of your device's data, 2 copies of the data “on-site,” (one copy on your device and another on an external hard drive), and 1 copy of your data “off-site,” like in a cloud storage system. While this strategy might seem like overkill, it's better to be prepared for the things that go bump in the digital night."},
{"paragraph": "Like most phishing schemes, QR code phishing, also known as \"quishing,\" preys on victims moving too quickly and not thinking critically about the links they click or scan. Starting in May 2023, a security firm observed a quishing campaign that haunted multiple industries and continues to see growth. To protect yourself from these spooky schemes, always make sure the QR code is from a reputable source. For in-person QR codes, such as the ones meant for parking payments, check for deceitful QR code stickers applied over the real ones."},
{"paragraph": "While the prospect of reanimating your devices during a nightly visit to the graveyard may be tempting, free public charging stations harbor chilling threats that should have, \"Be afraid. Be very afraid.\" ringing in your ear. Especially if those devices are used for hybrid work. The USB connections utilized in free charging stations not only transmit power but also data, leaving your devices open for cybercriminals to access your personal data and run malware. Instead use an AC outlet or charge-only USB adapter to ensure only power is being transmitted, keeping the cyber-specters of data theft at bay."},
{"paragraph": "As you may have heard in workplace cybersecurity training, dots and dashes aren't just important in Morse code; they are the sigils that guide the flow of web traffic. Seemingly inconspicuous alterations to a URL, such as the change from www.super.safe.website.com to www.super-safe.website.com, may serve as the skeleton key cybercriminals hold to access your secure data. When in doubt, use a search engine to find the URL you are looking for and never click on a link that gives you the heebie jeebies."},

{"paragraph": "Engaging in professional development as an adult learner, whether it's pursuing an advanced degree or a certification, will undoubtedly stretch you in many directions. Taking the next step in your career while managing work and life will demand not only commitment but also adaptability. The inevitable disruption of your regular routine, unexpected life events, and collaborating with peers to complete projects while handling life’s responsibilities will call for mindfulness, time management, and effective communication."},
{"paragraph": "According to The National Institutes of Health, “rates of anxiety have increased since the beginning of the pandemic.” The past few years taught us the importance of caring for one’s mind and body and that self-care is the foundation of a healthy and productive life. While a lot of your time as a student will be spent working on assignments and preparing for class, keeping in mind the importance of cultivating strong relationships is key to remaining healthy and balanced. Social connections are linked to increased happiness and overall better health."},
{"paragraph": "Along with focusing on nurturing your existing relationships and creating new ones, it’s important to explore beyond your study area. Erin Brogan, who is currently pursuing her Online Master of Science in Analytics, leans on the value of spending time outdoors. “Make sure you get out of the house, especially if you work at a computer all day.... Find ways to take your schoolwork on the go. Sit outside at a park or by the water,” she suggests. A change of scenery will prove to be revitalizing both physically and mentally. Professional Master’s in Occupational Safety and Health (PMOSH) professor, Jenny Houlroyd, reminds her students that taking care of your emotional well-being, getting enough sleep, and drinking plenty of water are “incredibly important to your cognitive skills.” Keeping both your body and mind healthy and active will help you relieve stress and avoid burnout."},
{"paragraph": "Continuing your education will require a shift in perspective. Treating this professional commitment as a part-time job is vital to keeping your eye on the prize and effectively managing your responsibilities. Throughout this journey, you will be supported and guided by an online community consisting of peers, alumni, faculty, and the student services team. Jennifer Wooley, Director of Academic Programs, highlights the importance of giving yourself time at the beginning of a program to find your rhythm, especially if it has been a while since you were in an academic setting. She recommends that students “be mindful of what is and isn’t working, from the time of day you study to the way you take notes. Don’t be afraid to make adjustments to your approach as this will set you up for success in the long run.”"},
{"paragraph": "Finding your pace and keeping it will depend on a few crucial factors such as staying on top of assignments and treating course videos like they are in-person classes. This means taking notes and jotting down any questions you may have to ask your professor during office hours. Going through the material and familiarizing yourself with the tools required for each course is also essential to ensure success throughout this process. Dimitri Mavris, Ph.D., executive director of the Professional Master’s in Applied Systems Engineering (PMASE) program, recommends working professionals who are pursuing graduate degrees “not fall back into the routine you had as undergrad students: focusing on just your grades.” Instead, he recommends treating this new challenge like coaching and tutoring, this gives working professionals an opportunity to focus not only on passing the course but on gaining new knowledge and strengthening their skills for the future."},
{"paragraph": "Along with taking care of your health and managing your time wisely, communicating is key to successfully completing your program. When asked his number one advice for new students taking his Modeling with SysML course, PMASE professor Richard Wise said, “communication, communication, communication.” Make sure you are reaching out to your professors, classmates, and family members regarding your progress as well as when you might need help.\"We are all here to help you succeed,\" Wise emphasized."},
{"paragraph": "“Life happens, and as your instructors, we understand that the hurdles life throws our way often occur without advance notice. Communicating with your professors is important to finding success in your program. This will allow us to assist you, the best we can, as you continue to balance life, work, and your ongoing professional development,\" says Joel Sokol, director of Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMS Analytics) degree program. While seeking guidance from your professors is important, focusing on building professional connections while on this journey is crucial for long-term success. Keeping the lines of communication open throughout the completion of your program will not only allow you to achieve a healthy work-life balance but may also help you manage any stress that comes with taking on this new academic challenge."},
{"paragraph": "Finally, remember to be present and fully enjoy the moment. Developing new skills and adjusting to a different lifestyle takes time, so give yourself props for investing in your professional growth and know you have what it takes to get to the finish line."},

{"paragraph": "“As I move up and into new roles at Georgia Tech, I still find myself returning to the principles of ASPIRE,” said Kate Curnow, senior program and operations manager for Housing and Residential Life."},
{"paragraph": "“The tools I learned give me confidence in troubleshooting challenges, while the growth mindset it instilled in me allows me to be a nimble and empathetic leader.\""},
{"paragraph": "Another key component of the program is the support and collaboration of the participants’ supervisor, or co-learner as referenced in the program. The key discussion points and learning prompts provided help guide coaching as well as identify opportunities to deepen the practice within the scope of day-to-day responsibilities increasing the supervisor's effectiveness as a leader."},
{"paragraph": "“Actively participating as a co-learner allowed me to collaboratively invest in the professional growth of the individual on my team,” says Shannon Helton-Amos, director of marketing and digital strategy at Georgia Tech Professional Education. “The opportunity to learn alongside, as well as, from them helped me grow as a leader while strengthening the capacity of our team overall.”"},
{"paragraph": "Upon completion of the course requirements, participants will be celebrated during a closing program and emerge with an increased awareness of themselves professionally and an understanding of how they can lead from their current role and positioned to take on new responsibilities. “We’ve seen the power this program has to positively impact culture within the Georgia Tech community and are excited to witness the potential of this new 2023 cohort unfold as they cultivate their leadership mindset through ASPIRE,” says LaTrese Ferguson, direcor, Workplace Learning & Professional Development."},

{"paragraph": "The strengths of a top-ten research university.  A combination of competence and ethics. Access to excellent faculty.  The flexibility of a liberal arts degree and the skills of a professional degree. Multiple opportunities for customizing the program of study.  Located in a thriving international city.  Excellent career opportunities."},
{"paragraph": "The Bachelor of Science in Public Policy (BSPP) provides strong analytical, communication, management, and leadership skills to students seeking careers in public service, law, and the private sector -- sectors in which professionals need to understand how government works, and can be helped to work better. These skills are coupled with a solid understanding of the complex political, social, ethical, and economic forces that shape public problems and their solutions."},
{"paragraph": "The BSPP program has a strong focus on critical thinking and analytic skills in multiple disciplines. The BSPP core curriculum provides a solid foundation in areas such as economics, organizational behavior, politics, and philosophy, then emphasizes problem-solving and analysis. At the same time, students choose two clusters in particular areas of policy to gain breadth and depth, and they can use their many free electives to build greater strengths in policy, law, philosophy, or political science -- or they can pursue a minor or certificate in language, economics, international affairs, history, management, etc. All students participate in at least one internship, and many opt for research experiences or study abroad. The BSPP curriculum prepares students for a culminating senior-year Policy Task Force project undertaken for an external public, not-for-profit, or private-sector client."},
{"paragraph": "The faculty of the School of Public Policy have doctorates in economics, political science, sociology, ethics, statistics, geography, and philosophy, as well as degrees in physics, electrical engineering, computational biology, international affairs, communication theory, city and regional planning, and the history of science. Recognized as one of the top programs in the world in the area of science and technology (S&T) policy (with particular strengths in research and innovation policy), the School's emphasis on S&T-related issues gives students a strong advantage in addressing topics related to energy and the environment, regional economic development, information and communications policy, and many areas of philosophy and ethics."},
{"paragraph": "Knowledge and techniques from these fields are integrated in core and elective courses and in the Policy Task Force:"},
{"paragraph": "Many BSPP students choose to focus additional effort in the School's pre-law or philosophy programs. In addition to the School's academic advising structure, every student is assigned a faculty mentor who will help with course selections, internship and research opportunities, and career preparation."},
{"paragraph": "With an excellent student-faculty ratio (about 3.5:1 for undergraduates), the School of Public Policy makes it easy for students and faculty to know and work with each other.  In addition to shaping a curriculum to fit their interests, students use internships, research experiences, and study abroad to extend their education beyond the classroom. Many students are able to take several courses taught at the masters level, and some choose to continue their education through a five-year BS/MS option. Not surprisingly, public policy undergraduates play a major role in campus organizations, and many become involved in state government and politics through a full-time legislative internship in spring semester."},
{"paragraph": "The School's alumni have gone on to careers in law, public health, management consulting, media, education, politics, transportation, city planning, and policy analysis. BSPP graduates from the last ten years include the director of Emory University's Global Health Law and Policy Project and law professor, a strategic planner for The New York Times, director of legislative research and policy for a business association, attorneys with law firms and the US Federal Courts, a data analyst for a major airline, a professor of industrial engineering at Georgia Tech, staff members in the US Congress, a research specialist for a national political organization, state lobbyist, political affairs director for the Israeli consulate, and many others in business and in local, state, and national government. In recent years many BSPP graduates have been hired by major management consulting firms including Deloitte, Accenture, Capgemini, and McKinsey."},

{"paragraph": "Public policy majors have a wealth of opportunities for internships in local, regional, and state government, and in diverse agencies and industries in the Atlanta area. Many intern in Washington D.C. and other cities, and many have signed up for two or three internships. Students use their internship experiences to prepare them for law school or graduate programs in policy, public health, or city and regional planning, while others pursue careers in private firms and consulting companies, nonprofit agencies, the media, state legislative and governors’ offices, the federal government, and a variety of other institutions.  About 30 percent of our graduates work in business and consulting, 30 percent have pursued careers in law, and the remainder have gone to graduate school (in public health, city and regional planning, policy, etc.) or have worked in nonprofit agencies, the media, federal agencies, state government, and politics."},

{"paragraph": "(Courses other than POL 1101 are usually restricted to BSPP majors)"},
{"paragraph": "POL 1101 - Government of the U.S. (Barke, Matisoff, Persons, Taylor) CORE\nThis course will explore fundamental concepts, theories, and issues of American politics and policy. We will do so by examining historical and current issues which confront the United States. American politics is a setting in which diverse interests compete over values, wealth, security, power, and ideas, with powers shared by three branches of government and spread across local, state, and federal levels. We will focus on fundamental tensions over power, interests, and the question of “who decides?” The course also provides insights into the roles and functions of the major institutions of American national government including the Congress, the presidency, the judiciary, and the federal bureaucracy, as well as the role of state and local governments. One goal of this class is to help you to think critically about how to judge the strengths and weaknesses of public policies."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 1142 - Teams and Collaboration (Wynens)\nFirst, this course examines the interpersonal processes and structural characteristics that influence the effectiveness of teams, individual behavior in face-to-face interactions, and the dynamics of interpersonal relationships. In short, we will examine “what does it take to be a good teammate?” Second, this course seeks to understand the theory and processes of group and team behavior to inform how you can effectively lead teams. This course will help you understand the general principles and processes of effective leadership so that you can lead in a wide variety of situations. Third, this course is intended to allow you to practice the art of engaging difficult problems in a team context. Deliberate use of effective team problem solving methods will be explored against the backdrop of effective team behavior and societal challenges."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 2010 - Political Processes (Barke) CORE\nPolitics in the policy process is about combining knowledge and analysis with individual and social beliefs, values, and preferences about a public problem into a collective decision that, ideally, promotes the public interest. We will focus on the procedures and institutions by which choices and values are created, shaped, and aggregated into public decisions, i.e., \"politics.\" Our focus is both on the “why” (models and theories about why the process works as it does) and the “how” (knowledge about how to be more effective as policy analysts or advocates). We will examine why fundamental concepts such as equity, security, decisions, incentives, rules, efficiency, and liberty are problematic, the roles that various stakeholders play in political processes, and whether politics and policy making can be explained by assuming rational actors and institutions that are constrained by constitutional and scientific principles. Students will research a policy issue of their choice and write a professional memo that proposes a politically feasible course of action based on stakeholder and institutional analyses."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 2010 - Introduction to Philosophy (Hoffman, Biddle)\nThis course is an introduction to some of the main themes of philosophy. We will examine some of the most fundamental issues of human existence, including the existence and nature of God; the nature of mind and the mind-body problem; freedom of will and moral responsibility; ethics, and existential issues."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 2012 - Foundations of Public Policy (Leggon)\nWe will explore policy as both a product and a process. Among the issues addressed are the policy cycle, evaluation, and ethical issues and the role of public opinion in public policy. Policy principles and processes will be examined in the context of specific issues such as health care, education, employment, social security, energy and the environment. Not available to BSPP majors."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 2025 - Philosophical Analysis for Policy Choices (Hoffman, Kirkman) CORE\nKirkman: This is a practical course in that the real work of the course will be in grappling with concrete, practical problem situations, taking them as opportunities to acquire and practice skills in rigorous inquiry, including analysis, synthesis, and critical consideration. Such inquiry is philosophical in that it focuses mainly on the normative aspects of public policy – matters of value, obligation and character – which extend downward to more basic philosophical questions regarding knowledge and hope, and outward to questions of political legitimacy. The course will follow a problem-based learning (PBL) approach, which means students themselves, working together in groups, will explore an array of concrete problems that involve ethical and epistemological questions; students will also work together to acquire and hone the tools of philosophical inquiry in public policy."},
{"paragraph": "Hoffman: Disagreement on matters of public policy often turns on philosophical questions regarding the validity of factual claims (epistemology), values to be pursued or obligations to be met (ethics), and (often implicit) decisions on how to frame a particular policy problem. This course introduces basic theories and concepts from the philosophical tradition as resources for a critical reflection on these issues. A variety of policy-choice problems will be used to practice the application of these theories and concepts. The course combines individual work followed by class discussions with a problem-based learning (PBL) approach, which means students themselves, working together in groups, will explore an array of concrete problems that involve ethical and epistemological questions."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 2030 - Organizations and Policy (Fox, Kingsley) CORE\nOrganizations and Policy focuses on what we need to understand about the organizational settings in which we live and work, and the policies that shape (and reflect) public and private organizations. We address: major perspectives on organizations and why these matter; views of what goes on inside of organizations (including culture and control, power, inequalities, conflict, and deviance); organizations and the broader environments in which they exist; ways that organizations adapt and transform over time; and futures of organizations and policy."},
{"paragraph": "POL 2101 - State and Local Government (Kingsley, Polak)\nStudents will learn via a hands-on problem based experience of state and local government policy making in the United States. The class is divided into five parts: 1) Analytical problem solving to formulate a solution for a policy problem of the student’s choice. 2) Foundations of political institutions and policy making from an institutional and political perspective. 3) Hands on experience advocating for a policy solution by directly engaging with political and policy leaders. 4) Understanding of political campaigning at the state and local level. 5) Knowledge of current policy issues and challenges."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3000 - US Constitutional Issues (Slieper)\nThis course will provide students with an overview of the US Constitution, including its history, methods for judicial interpretation, the commerce clause, and various cases dealing with civil rights and liberties, religious liberties, and more. We will focus a good deal on the individuals involved in the cases studied, and you will gain skills around reading and interpreting judicial opinions that will serve you well in law school should you choose to attend. Much of the course’s learning takes place in small group in-class discussions, where you will often role-play as Supreme Court Justices."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3016 - Judicial Process (Weizenecker, Tinsley)\nIn this course we will cover the functions, structures, and procedures of state and federal court systems. The course will address civil and criminal procedure in addition to judicial concepts that apply to both civil and criminal cases such as jury selection, statutory interpretation, and the rules of evidence. We will study different types of law that impact judicial decisions: statutes, case law, and rules of evidence and procedure."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3020 - Applied Political Economy (Mueller, Taylor) CORE"},
{"paragraph": "Political economy (PE) is the study of the relationship between the government, economy and society. Most of the ‘big ideas’ that shape public policy have their origin in theories of political economy. Hence political-economy provides the basis for policy intervention (or non- intervention) in socio-economic affairs. And these theories then get revised by our experience with public policy. Applied Political Economy has two goals: 1) to equip students with the theories, methods, and case studies of political economy, and 2) to teach students to apply those theories and methods to the analysis of societal problems and to the public policy initiatives that might be used to respond to those problems."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3030 - Policy Analysis (Bullinger, Kingsley) CORE\nPolicy analysis involves the structured investigation into rationales for and practice of public policy."},
{"paragraph": "“Structured” does not mean “value-free,” however, and policy analysis combines scientific methods with values. The focus of the course is on developing practical techniques for analyzing policies and, ultimately helping policymakers arrive at viable and informed policy choices with a credible expectation of what the expected outcomes of those policy choices will be. A variety of concepts underpinning policy development and implementation are developed and linked to evaluating policy impacts. Students also will learn about the assumptions that underlie those concepts and techniques, and about the professional roles and responsibilities of policy analysts. The first part of the course integrates theories and analytical approaches learned in coursework in the study of more advanced policy analysis. The second part of the course emphasizes application of these approaches to selected real-world policy problems. Students will participate in exercises that illustrate the techniques and challenges of policy analysis."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3042 - Data Science for Public Policy (Asensio)\nThe amount of data in our world has been exploding in nearly every sector in the economy and analyzing large data, so-called big data, will become the basis of competition, productivity growth and innovation. Public sector organizations are using data to boost productivity and improve the speed of public statistics and services. Companies are using data-driven strategies to more precisely tailor products and services with predictive analytics. Policies will need to be developed in a big data world to deal with issues surrounding information privacy, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning and smart cities. Techniques used to mine consumer and industry data provide new platforms for controlled experimentation and large-scale data aggregation that is ideally suited for policy analysis and program evaluation. However, there is currently a shortage of trained data scientists in both the private and public sectors. This course introduces data science tools and quantitative methods for public policy and social science applications. Students will learn foundations of big data analytics, experiments and causal inference, and prediction problems in the social sciences. Lectures, hands-on case studies and discussion."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3050 - Political Philosophy (Hoffman, Kirkman)\nKirkman: Students will work together in groups on careful and thoughtful reading of primary source materials in political philosophy, beginning with three variants of democratic theory (Locke, Rousseau, Young). The aim of this close reading will be to gain an understanding of key concepts in political philosophy, the distinctions and connections among them, and the degree to which they are organized into distinct theoretical frameworks. Students will then use these theoretical frameworks as tools for analysis, option generation, and critical consideration of complex practical problems in public life. The practical focus of the course is on grappling with complex problem situations in public life and critical consideration of possible options for responding to such situations, using theoretical frameworks to assist you in identifying issues and assumptions. The learning outcomes of the course all involve acquiring the tools of normative inquiry in political philosophy and using those tools in responding to particular, concrete and messy problem situations. A messy problem situation is one in which a decision is to be made that hinges on matters of value and obligation but in which there may not be just one correct response or even just one way of understanding the problem."},
{"paragraph": "Hoffman: This class focuses on theories of democracy. Based on a reading for each class meeting, we will (1) compare democracy with other forms of governance and discuss why democracy might be worth to pursue; (2) compare various historical approaches to democracy; (3) discuss problems with how democratic institutions and processes are constituted in the United States and how they could be improved; and we will (4) discuss deliberative and more radical approaches to democracy."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3102 - Ancient Philosophy (C. Johnson)\nWhy did modern scientific thought emerge when it did and not thousands of years earlier? What can the history of inquiry into the natural world tell us about why we think the way we do today? Does the history of science matter for scientific practice today? To answer these questions, this course will trace the history of philosophy from its earliest days in ancient Greece up to the emergence of the modern age in the Renaissance. We will begin by looking at how recognizably philosophical thinking arose with changes in the conception of what an individual is and what we can know about the natural world. We will follow trends in cosmology, astronomy, physics, epistemology, ontology, conceptions of the individual, and individual creativity. By the time we arrive at the Renaissance, we will understand why the soil was fertile for the modern worldview to emerge. By seeing the developments that led to the modern world, we can bring to light our own assumptions and better understand the philosophical assumptions implicit in scientific theories. By participating in an ongoing dialog about the worldview changes that shaped philosophical thought throughout the earliest portion of philosophy’s history, students will see how modern thought emerged, why it emerged when it did, and what implications this has for creative scientific thought today."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3103 - Modern Philosophy (Johnson, Kirkman)\nDuring the 16th & 17th centuries, as the Scientific Revolution took root in the West, new questions arose about the origin and nature of knowledge, the nature of existence, and best way to live when other people are around. In this course we will study how thinkers of this “Modern Era” approached these questions, while simultaneously attempting to trace connections to our current lived experience. Philosophers like Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, and Hume will be our teachers, as we seek to untangle how in the world we know anything at all. And perhaps also how we know that we know anything at all..."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3109 - Engineering Ethics (Kirkman, Rosenberger)\nThis course covers issues of professional ethics for engineering and other technical professions. We read from the history of philosophical thinking on ethics, consider ethical situations specific to the practice of engineering, and explore a variety of topics that relate to the engineer’s role in society. Through the lens of ethical theory, we examine a variety of concrete cases. These cases apply to both the ethical aspects of the engineering workplace, and to the nature of design. Classwork includes exams, short writing assignments, and group work. Through this course we see that engineers are not simply everyday workers who just happen to have a job that requires a lot of technical training. They are professionals upon whose judgment our society depends. And they are creative thinkers with the potential to address some of the world’s most pressing problems."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3115 - Philosophy of Science (Biddle)\nPhilosophical reflection is an important part of science. Scientists such as Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein did not just do science. They also reflected upon – and in some cases effected changes in – its aims, methods, standards, and criteria for success. In the first part of this course, we will discuss a number of these issues, including the boundary between science and pseudoscience, objectivity and rationality in science, and the nature of scientific laws and explanation. In the second part of the course, we will address questions concerning the relationship between science and society, including the role of values and interests in science and the connections between science and the economy."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3120 - Statistical Analysis for Public Policy (Massetti, Rogers) CORE\nStatistical analysis is a fundamental tool in public policy and is used to analyze a wide range of problems. The goal of this course is to provide training in quantitative methods to describe how economic, political, and social relationships develop, persist, and change. The course is divided in three parts. In the first part we will introduce methods to describe data using statistics and graphical representations. We will also briefly cover methods to collect data. In the second part we will study probability, randomness, random variables and inference. The main goal of the second part is to understand how the results of empirical analysis based on a limited sample can be extended to the whole population. The third part will introduce linear regression and multiple regression as tools to characterize the relationship between one variable of interest (the \"dependent\" variable) and one or more \"explanatory\" variables. Theory will be used to provide guidance but the emphasis will be on applications and practical examples. Students will also master statistical software for data management, data representation and data analysis. All students will be required to present a final project in which they will apply methods covered during the course. The course does not require any previous training in statistics or in advanced mathematics."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3127 – Science, Technology, & Human Values (Biddle, Hoffman, Klein)"},
{"paragraph": "Klein: “The Contemporary Enlightenment.” The class explores the philosophical theme of enlightenment and applies it to today’s society. The class explores enlightenment philosophy in relation to propaganda, consumer culture, religion, education, and economic development. The class teaches methods for the critique of culture and consciousness, and it reviews various cases by which philosophical concepts of “freedom” and “value” can be realized. Readings include works by Plato, Kant, and Schopenhauer as well as Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, and Adam Smith."},
{"paragraph": "Biddle and Hoffman: New technologies can change how we perceive the world and how we interact with other people, and they can open up entirely new spaces for decision making. Technologies shape both us and the societies in which we are living. This means, there are several groups of people who have responsibilities that are significant from an ethical point of view: the designers of technologies; those who invest in the development of technologies; manufacturers; regulators and law makers; and the users of these technologies."},
{"paragraph": "A major problem with regard to this ethical responsibility is that we—as individuals—are always cognitively limited in our ability to anticipate negative consequences of technologies that look, at first glance, interesting, exciting, or beneficial. In particular, it is difficult to imagine that there might be people out there who are driven by values that we do not share or by needs and interests we do not understand. For this reason the design, development, production, regulation, and use of technology should be treated as a “wicked problem.” A wicked problem is a problem that can be framed in a number of different ways, depending on who is looking at it. This means that the formulation of the problem becomes itself a problem. Decisions on wicked problems often lead to unethical results when people who are affected by these decisions are overlooked; to confusion when we do not understand that others look at the same problem from a completely different point of view; or to serious conflicts among people who have to deal with these problems."},
{"paragraph": "The course combines individual work followed by class discussions with a problem-based learning (PBL) approach, which means students themselves, working together in groups, will explore an array of concrete problems that involve ethical and epistemological questions."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3130 - Research Methods and Problem Solving (Levine, Marco) CORE\nThis course is an introduction to the techniques of social science research. It will combine discussions on the nature of social science research with hands-on experience. The course equips students with useful knowledge of different methods (e.g., experiments, surveys, field work, unobtrusive research) for doing public policy research that is reliable and applicable. Skills provided will be useful for future careers such as a data analyst in industry, consultant, policy analyst, or academic researcher."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3135 - Philosophy of Technology (Rosenberger)\nThis course explores the various ways that technologies shape many of our deepest notions and institutions, from our politics, to our personal relationships, to our ethics, to our sense of selfhood. We’ll read the works of contemporary thinkers, and consider the changes to our lives brought to our lives by the technologies all around us, including mobile computing, social media, television, classroom technologies, genetic modification, and bodily implants."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3140 - Philosophy of Food (Biddle)\nFood is something that is fundamental to our lives, and for most of human history, and kinds of questions that people asked about food were correspondingly basic. Is this berry edible, or will it make me sick? Where are the animals we can eat, and how can we kill them? Which crops will grow during which seasons? How can we eat in the winter? At bottom, all of these questions about food boil down to perhaps the most basic one of all: How can we get enough of it? While contemporary societies have some of the same questions – the problem of getting enough food is still a serious one for many in our world – we also have different, and more complicated, questions. If we walk through the aisles of our local grocery store, pick out an item, and ask where it comes from, the answer will, in many cases, be far from obvious. This is especially clear when we read, or attempt to read, the list of ingredients. Contemporary methods of food production are radically different from anything that we have known in the past, which raises the question of whether these methods are justifiable – morally, politically, economically, and environmentally."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3141- Leading Change in Social Organizations (Wynens)\nWelcome to public leadership 2.0. Today's public leadership environment demands more creativity, innovation, and adaptability than ever. The pressure of leading in the public sphere is magnified by the demands of the electorate and elected officials, often pushing for immediate answers to complex and seemingly intractable problems. How can public leaders respond effectively to this situation? This course is designed to give the student a sound understanding of how to lead and manage change in public organizations, as well as the opportunity to explore new and innovative responses to public issues. Many social and public problems will no longer yield to conventional methods. In many cases, governance will replace government, networks will replace hierarchies, and partnerships will be used instead of large-scale government intervention as a way to address social, technical, economic, and environmental issues. A new source of responding to societal issues is emerging in the form of collaboration, partnership, and ad-hoc networks of interested and affected parties. Students can expect a mix of simulation, negotiation exercises, case studies, small group discussion, presentation, and seminar discussion. This course will develop skills and knowledge pertinent to designing and responding to emergent complex societal challenges through innovative and dynamic leadership methods."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3150 - Politics and Policy (Barke)\nWe flip the usual approach in policy courses: instead of starting with concepts and theories then using current events and controversies to illustrate them, we begin with a consideration of issues then use a scaffold of concepts and (when possible) theories for understanding them. Recent topics (selected in cooperation with students) included economic inequality, the student loan mess, subsidies for technological research, ACA implementation, gerrymandering, etc. We approach current issues suggested by students or the headlines as multi-attribute, multi- stakeholder problems with multiple possible solutions, looking at the substance of the issues, the politics within and outside policy institutions, and how the media and the public are perceiving and reacting to these topics. Our goal is to explore both the what and the why of current policy controversies, using what scholars and practitioners have learned about these issues and decision processes. Students will learn how to navigate and assess the online flood of information about policy and politics and how to create an appropriate personal strategy for learning about current events. Many of the class meetings are conducted as congressional hearings in which students sometimes appear as expert witnesses, having prepared an official written statement and an oral presentation, and at other times as members of Congress with opening statements and questions with which to engage the witnesses."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3180 - Biomedical Ethics (Biddle)\nThis course will be a primarily case-based survey of the main issues in contemporary biomedical ethics. Biomedical ethics is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that draws (at least) upon perspectives and expertise from medicine, nursing, public health, law, anthropology, religious studies, literature, psychology, political science, and philosophy. Although we will engage with all of these disciplines to some extent, our focus will be on philosophical methods and perspectives. The topics that we will address include: reproduction, health care systems and resource allocation, doctor-patient relationships and clinical ethics, medical experiments and research ethics, the nature of disease, and death and end of life care. While one of the primary goals of the course is to develop an understanding of the field of bioethics, there are other goals that are important not only for those who wish to continue to study philosophy, but virtually any other subject as well. In particular, this course should help you to learn to understand the structure of arguments, to present arguments clearly, and to evaluate arguments. The course assignments – student presentations, midterm and final exams, etc. are meant to help you achieve these goals."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3201 – Introduction to Social Policy (Leggon)\nThis course begins by distinguishing between social policy that focuses on “social welfare” (enhancing existing conditions of social wellbeing in society) and “social ill-fare” (when human needs are not met, problems are not managed, and opportunities are not maximized). Selected social policy issues in the United States are examined using the sociological perspective—that is, analyses of the economic, political, and cultural factors that provide the contexts within which social policy is framed, operationalized, implemented and evaluated."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3210 - U.S. Health Policy (Persons)\nThis course examines the ways in which American society has thus far made purposive decisions about how health care services are organized, how we finance and pay for health care services, and the means by which healthcare is delivered in the U.S. The course aids reflection on the interesting and complex contradictions of how – despite the U.S. having achieved one of the world’s highest standards of living – questions of ensuring “universal health care,” or guaranteeing health care to all, as a right of citizenship remain highly contentious ideas. Issues of health policy will undoubtedly help to shape the lived experience of Americans over the life course of today’s college students."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3214 - African-American Politics (Persons)\nThis course is an overview and examination of the political approaches utilized by African American citizens, and their supporters, in pursuit of the rights of African Americans for “universal freedom” and fulsome citizenship rights in the United States of America. The course covers varying conceptualizations of freedom, and examines strategic efforts to realize freedom for Blacks via social movements, interest groups, political parties, public policy, voting and elective office, and the use of legal processes and the legal system. The course uses historical summaries as the backdrop for contemporary political analyses."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3230 - STEM Education Policy (Kingsley)\nThis course explores the role of public policy in shaping the conduct of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education in the United States. We will be examining the policy subsystems that govern portions of the pipeline of the production of scientific and technical human capital. Particular attention will be given to STEM education in K-12 public schools. In doing so, we will compare and contrast the relevant policy subsystems and explore how they influence, and at times conflict, with one another. While conducting our review of these policy subsystems we will be drawing upon a variety of tools developed in the policy sciences for understanding the behaviors of actors within a policy subsystem. These tools include policy process models, policy analysis, and policy evaluation. We will examine the particular ways in which these tools are applied in STEM education policies."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3244 - Stem Cell Science, Policy, & Ethics (Levine)\nStem cells and related technologies offer the potential to advance our understanding of human diseases and lead us to a new era of regenerative medicine. Yet scientific research using stem cells raises profound ethical questions, and deciding whether to support and how to regulate stem cell science has posed challenges for policymakers in the United States and around the world. This class will explore the history, current state of the art and likely future of stem cell science. To do so, we will examine different types of stem cell science (e.g. adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells) and research in related fields, such as cloning. For each topic, we will assess the current state of scientific knowledge and examine relevant ethical issues and policy considerations. At the end of the course, students will have a solid grounding in the stem cell debate, complemented by an ability to assess ethical issues and participate in and contribute to policy debates on the development of emerging technologies in the life sciences."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3315 - Environmental Policy & Politics (Favero)\nThe course will focus on what constitutes effective environmental policy. It starts by analyzing the evolution of environmental policy and actors. Then, it analyzes why environmental policies are needed, using the concepts of negative externalities and public goods. After that, the course will discuss environmental policy instruments for addressing environmental issues at the local, regional, and global levels. Finally, it examines global and domestic issues addressed by environmental policies: climate change, local air pollution, energy, transportation, water pollution, and waste. This final section is dedicated to the topic of sustainable development. The goal of this course is to provide training in environmental policies to describe how economic, political, and social relationships develop, persist, and change. Students will have the ability to critically analyze environmental policies in the real world. They will be able to describe and analyze environmental policy tools and their implications."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3320 – Climate Policy (Favero, Garcia)\nClimate change is a global problem requiring unprecedented international cooperation and interdisciplinary investigation. This course aims to address the broad complexity of climate change by bringing together the science of climate change, the analysis of impacts, and the economic, political and engineering strategies to reduce emissions. In class we will use these different perspectives to address the fundamental question: What is climate change and how should we respond to it? This class will be taught as a seminar: students will be actively engaged in exploring the different issues underlying the threat of climate change and the institutions engaged in negotiating an international response."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3350 - Energy Policy (Brown, Matisoff)\nThe course focuses on policies implemented in the U.S. and abroad to promote the development and market penetration of sustainable energy options. Reflecting the need to design policies to address the market and other barriers faced by different types of technologies, the course is divided into policy-technology bundles. These include, for example, low-carbon fuel standards to promote biofuels and plug-in electric vehicles; real-time electricity pricing to promote renewable, distributed power, and a smart grid; building standards and product labeling to encourage high performance buildings; renewable electricity standards and tax credits to promote renewable technologies (solar power, wind energy, etc.); and the role of loan guarantees for nuclear, carbon capture and sequestration, and other large-scale energy projects. The concept of a cumulative greenhouse gas budget for the U.S. and the globe will be introduced and will provide a means of framing policy and technology decision-making."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3502 – Information Technology, Communications, & Telecommunications Policy (Mueller) Public policy for the communications infrastructure. Is Facebook a media company or a tech company? How, if at all, should it be regulated? What does network neutrality mean, and how would it affect consumers and companies? Will cable networks die because of cord-cutting? Can wireless networks provide a competitive alternative to the cable companies? Who decides how much radio spectrum is given to mobile networks, television broadcasters, or Wi-Fi networks? How much government surveillance takes place on the network? Are telecom companies competitive or monopolistic? Students will study the evolution of the information and communication industries, the impact of technological change on those industries, and the changing regulatory institutions associated with their rise and decline."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3520 - Globalization and Policy (Taylor)\nThis course will serve as an introduction to the fundamental concepts, theories, conflicts, and issues of globalization. It will do so by employing some basic theories and tools of analysis from both international economics and international political economy. The first part of the course will review these theories and analytical tools and explore their applicability to globalization. The second part of the course will prompt students to specialize in an empirical case or policy issue of their choice, and become as expert on it as possible. In this course, you will discover that the world economy is, and has always been, in a state of contention. It is a setting in which global, national, and sub-national interest groups are pitted against one another in a contest over wealth, security, power, and ideas. You will explore how these different interest groups affect and are affected by globalization. Finally, you will find that estimations of whether policy is “good” or “bad” in the world economy often depends on who you are as a political-economic actor: your assets, interests, beliefs, and values. This course is not a seminar, instead it uses a lecture format with some discussion."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3600 - Sustainability, Technology, & Policy (Massetti, Reeves)\nThis course provides a solid introduction to the concept of sustainable growth and development. Sustainability is a broad and somehow necessarily vague concept that can be interpreted in many different ways. The goal of this class is to provide tools to professionally navigate the current debate on sustainability. Students from all backgrounds will learn how to read the specialized literature and to actively engage in the promotion of sustainability. We will start by critically reviewing the most influential definitions of sustainability, using a broad range of cultural and philosophical perspectives. We will then learn how to test if a development pathway is sustainable or not using real-world cases. Intra- and inter-generational conflicts on the use of resources will be discussed. Technology is both part of the problem – technological progress has so far increased our use of natural resources – and part of the solution – technological progress can reduce the trade-off between development and ecological degradation. We will review case studies of sustainable development strategies, from global climate change to sustainable business strategies, and we will learn about their strengths and weaknesses. Technological progress alone does not guarantee a sustainable future. The final part of the course will review policies that have potential to enhance technologies and societal transformation to ensure sustainability."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 3610 - Pre-Law Seminar (Liu, Strickland, Pernini, Carr, Swindle)\nThe Pre-Law Seminar is designed for students who are seriously considering law school. The class is co-taught by attorneys at Atlanta law firms. The class is divided into two segments. The first segment will introduce students to career paths in law along with skills and topics that will provide students with concentrated preparation for the first year of law school. Students will study topic such as contracts, torts, constitutional law, and more, will learn to brief cases, and will participate in various career panels and exercises to help them better envision what a career in law is like. The second segment will introduce students to some of the oral advocacy skills that are essential to a career in litigation. Students will make an oral presentation to the class simulating the work of a trial attorney and will draft outlines for direct and cross examinations and opening and closing arguments."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 3790 – Philosophy of Cognitive Science (Buskell)"},
{"paragraph": "The central aim of cognitive science is to understand how the mind works. This is an incredibly demanding and ambitious goal—one taken up by a diverse range of disciplines, not least artificial intelligence, cognitive anthropology, experimental and developmental psychology, neuroscience, and robotics. Yet the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science generates further questions and problems. Key here is how the cognitive scientist should relate the different concepts, sources of evidence, and explanatory models used in different fields. This is where philosophy contributes. First, by articulating and integrating the principles and concepts at work in cognitive science. Second, by exploring just what it means to have a mind at all—what it means to be a thinking thing. This course introduces cutting-edge philosophical and empirical methods of cognitive science, asking questions such as: “Is the mind like a computer?”, “Are there such things as group minds?”, “Do people from different cultures think differently?”, “What can AI teach us about our own minds?” and, “Might we upload our minds in the future?”."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4010 / 4020 - Policy Task Force I / II (Hicks, Youtie) CORE\nTask Force I and II are the required two-semester client-based senior capstone design project for public policy majors. In this course you will use knowledge of policy processes, ethical issues, economics, political economy, as well as the tools of statistics and research methods to answer a question posed by an external organization involved in actual public policy making. You will work as part of a team and will deliver a professional written report to the client, present your project to the client, and show off your project to the GT community (and possibly win a cash prize) at the campus-wide capstone design expo in McCamish Pavilion in the spring."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4111 - Internet & Public Policy (Klein)\nThis class provides a broad overview of Internet governance and of Internet policy. The class examines the origins and functioning of Internet institutions at different levels of governance. These include the IETF for standards, ICANN and the FCC for regulation, national governments for public policy, and the ITU and treaty bodies for international agreements. A survey of substantive policies will examine privacy, free speech, decency, security, intellectual property, and war. The class also examines practitioners’ tactics and strategies for “navigating institutions” to achieve desired policy outcomes."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4120 - Survey Research Methods (Melkers)\nSurvey data are used in a range of disciplinary and professional settings. From survey research on science and the environment, to political polling and public opinion, surveys are very much a part of our lives. The purpose of this course is to provide students in public policy and other disciplines with a solid grounding in survey research methods. Students will become familiar with all aspects of survey design, development and implementation. This will include issues that are critical to designing and conducting surveys, including cognitive aspects of survey response, sampling procedures, and questionnaire design, among others. Surveys are implemented in a number of ways, including telephone, mail, internet, and social media. Students will learn the appropriate uses of each, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Important factors in the successful design and implementation will also be addressed, including interviewer effects, respondent behavior and cognition, and response issues. Undergraduate and graduate students from all disciplines are welcome."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4140 - Foundations of Leadership (Wynens)\nStudents will become familiar with different ways of exercising leadership, their own strengths and weaknesses, and how they can best work with others in a leadership context. They will learn and apply leadership skills in a hands-on practical way that encourages them to challenge their own beliefs and assumptions about what constitutes leadership. This course offers a comprehensive review of contemporary issues and perspectives on leadership, including multidisciplinary and systems-oriented approaches as well as classic theory, moving to the examination of evolving contemporary beliefs. The emphasis is on application of concepts in actual leadership settings and situations. Topics include development of leadership theories, personal assessment and development, values and ethics, motivation, power, followership, group dynamics, multiculturalism in leadership, conflict resolution, performance excellence, and the change process. Through a process of readings, self-discovery, group observations, and case studies, the student will identify, observe, analyze, and apply new leadership behaviors. Learning more about leadership will help every student meet their leadership challenges. The learning objectives are designed to give you insights into leadership theory and how it applies in real world contexts. Specifically, you will improve and address your skills in key areas of leadership, including change and innovation, reflection, collaboration, communication, conflict, and multi-cultural awareness."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 4176 - Environmental Ethics (Kirkman)\nThis course presupposes an unusually broad understanding of environment and of environmental ethics. Rather than thinking only of wild nature “out there,” or otherwise about big, abstract concerns of pollution or climate change, the scope of the course may encompass any problem situation involving a common environment, that is, a place or a situation shared with other people and living things. Environmental problems in this expanded sense come to our attention because of one of the great accomplishments of the twentieth century: systems theory, which reveals the complex intertwining and the emergent behaviors of the systems that shape our shared environments and channel human aspirations and human conduct in particular ways. Ecological and other natural systems are of central importance in understanding and responding to problem situations that arise within shared environments, but so are social systems and technological systems. This course will follow a problem-based learning (PBL) approach, which means you yourselves, working together in groups, will develop and explore difficult – perhaps even wicked – problem situations that call for decisions within and about shared environments. The aim is to cultivate a kind of systems imagination as part of moral imagination, a specific set of cognitive skills for noticing and responding to systems and to the ethical values caught up in them."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4200 - Social Policy Issues (Leggon)\nPUBP 4200 builds on PUB3201 Introduction to Social Policy. This course is designed to maximize students’ engagement and participation in discussions and debates. Additional course requirements include policy memos and a term paper. Among the topics/issues included are public opinion (which public(s) and whose opinions?), educational achievement, public understanding of science, health care (disparities, inequalities, and policy implications), and gun control."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4211 - Urban Policy (Rafter, Lipscomb)\nThis course examines the development and effects of urban planning and policymaking. Using both historical and contemporary case studies, we will study how urban problems are identified and conceptualized, how different policies are developed to address these problems, and what the impacts of these policies are on different communities and areas within the city. Topics to be covered include housing segregation, gentrification and neighborhood change, urban economic development, public and alternative transportation, urban education, criminal justice and policing, urban sustainability and the application of new technologies to urban problems. While the focus of the course will largely be on planning and policymaking in American cities, we will also take a comparative approach and examine urban policy issues in other nations."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4212 - Women and Public Policy (Leggon)\nWe will examine issues concerning women and public policy from a sociological perspective—that is, analyses of the confluence of political, economic, and social conditions that provide the context within which policy is devised, implemented, and evaluated. Specifically, the course explores the bi-directional relationship between women and public policy: the intended and unintended impacts of policy on women and of women on policy, and the ramifications and implications of having no policy. Issues include women in clinical trials, women as asylum seekers, and women in the military."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4214 - Gender, Science, Technology, & Public Policy (Leggon, Fox)\nThis course will interest and inform students concerned about issues of participation and performance as key to the creativity, productivity, and innovation of science and technology. We will learn about the experience and conditions of women and men in scientific and technological fields and the ways these are explained by: (1) educational patterns and practices (from pre-school through graduate education); (2) organization and cultures of workplaces; (3) evaluation, recognition, and rewards; (4) work and family; (5) meanings of science - related to gender; (6) reasons that scientists stay in - and leave- their fields; (7) and more. Throughout, we examine policies that will enhance both women's, as well as men's, contributions to scientific and technological fields. The class provides opportunities for students to develop their critical understandings and participate in discussion on the issues."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4226 - Business and Government (Lipscomb)\nThe role of business in the policy process represents an unresolvable tension at the core of policymaking. On the one hand, policymakers seeking to design and implement public policies that promote job creation and economic growth must take into account the impact of new policies on the business community. On the other, the business community represents a powerful set of interests whose goals and preferences often do not align with those of policymakers and the public. In this class, we will explore the complex interactions between business and government in the policy realm. The course will emphasize both positive and normative questions, including: What are the major channels through which business impacts the policy process? What are successful strategies for businesses that seek to have a policy impact? How can policymakers design new policies that both achieve social goals and maintain the support of key business interests? The course will rely heavily on cases and real-world examples from a variety of policy domains, including financial policy, health care policy, environmental policy, and urban policy. Students taking the class will learn how to systematically evaluate the role of competing interests in policy debates—and learn strategies to ensure that their side wins."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4410 - Science, Technology, & Public Policy (Hicks, Leggon)\nGovernment’s main concern with regard to science and technology used to be ensuring the research enterprise was sustainable, especially basic science. Today other goals prevail: science systems are asked to respond better to a more diverse set of stakeholders and must adapt to changes in the processes of knowledge creation and transfer. Research has moved from scientific disciplines to multidisciplinary, multi-institutional networks and the boundary between curiosity-driven and problem oriented research has become blurred. This course will examine this set of challenges, look at how the classical post-WWII contract between science and society is becoming ever more complex, and explore some of the tensions that result. Specific topics will include: national and international funding of R&D; intellectual property and its impacts; contemporary institutional roles; STEM talent; innovation, and so on."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4440 - Regulation, Science, & Technology (Barke)\nMany of the most important policy decisions are made by regulatory agencies. Perhaps you don’t plan to work for the FDA, FCC, or EPA, but your work – whether public, private, legal, or nonprofit – certainly will involve regulations. In this course you’ll learn how regulatory agencies make regulations, to whom they listen and respond, and how elected officials, experts, and interest groups shape regulatory policy. When should regulations command people and industries, when should they simply inform, and when should we be left alone? How can regulators compare the benefits and costs of policies? How are risks to humans and the environment considered and weighed against costs of avoidance? In short, how do and should agencies decide? How will you be able to participate -- and perhaps lead -- in shaping regulatory decisions with wide impact? We’ll examine regulatory/legal history, major provisions of administrative law and procedure, stakeholder analysis, the role of experts and the public, and the treatment of scientific and behavioral uncertainty. Among the possible specific topics and examples will be climate change regulation (mechanisms, values, tradeoffs), FDA drug regulations (international cooperation, precautionary approaches) in the US and EU, and the regulation of long-term policy issues (health, energy, environment). Students will do several short projects on regulatory topics of their own choosing."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4501 - Information Policy & Management (Rogers)\nThe course is an introduction to the role of information and knowledge in modern private and public organizations. It covers theoretical aspects of information seeking, gathering, and use in organizations as well as knowledge creation and its role in management. The course also addresses the practical implementation of organization information strategies using information technology. The first part of the course introduces the issues of organization strategy and its relation to information. The second part focuses on the notion of organizational learning. The third part focuses on the applications of information technology in government, especially related to various aspects of e-government. The final section focuses on new approaches to knowledge management in the public sector. Case examples are used throughout the course to illustrate the concepts of each section. The purpose of the course is to enable students to think conceptually about the modern organization, both in the private and the public sector, as a knowledge-based, information processing organization and to acquire analytical skills necessary to be a successful analyst or manager of a knowledge-based organization."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4530 - Introduction to Geographic Information Systems (Giarrusso; City Planning)"},
{"paragraph": "Many disciplines require information about the location of people, places, activities, and various resources, both natural and synthetic. City and regional planning, environmental science, real estate, transportation, geography, logistics, politics and international affairs are just a few disciplines that make use of this 'spatial' or location based information. Effective management and analysis of this information requires a Geographic Information System (GIS); a system of hardware and software used for storage, retrieval, management and, most importantly, analysis of spatial data. GIS systems are used in numerous disciplines and can be helpful for a variety of applications. The readings and lectures are designed to serve this purpose. The lab sessions will provide students with hands-on experience using ArcGIS PRO and ArcGIS Online, arguably the most widely used GIS software in the world. By the end of the course, students are expected to understand the basic components of a geographic information system and to be proficient using ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Online"},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4620 - Environmental Law (O’Day)"},
{"paragraph": "Environmental law is a relatively young specialty in the practice of law. Based largely on statutes enacted by the US Congress and the States since 1970, environmental law as a subject explores the various sources of law that govern business, individuals, and governments in their conduct which affects the environment. Although the principal focus of environmental law in the past has been the laws passed by Congress that regulate how we pollute and manage the natural world, our actions are also governed by detailed environmental regulations promulgated by agencies delegated the implementation of federal legislation, by State and local laws and regulations, and by principles of common law generally applicable to our conduct which take on special meaning and significance in the environmental arena. This class will examine the various ways in which the law attempts to engage these issues, either through common law, public regulation, or judicial determination. But we will not stop there. Through study and discussion of current enviro-political issues, we will explore the philosophical, ethical, and political underpinnings of environmental law, and ways to improve how environmental law is created and implemented. Because there are so many areas of environmental law, we cannot possibly cover every topic in this class. We will focus on the principal pieces of environmental legislation, touching briefly on other relevant laws and legal principles."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4640 - Technology Law, Policy, & Management (Huffman, McNay)\nThis course has several objectives. First, the course will review laws, regulations, and policies implicated in developing and/or managing technology. Specifically, the class will provide an in-depth analysis of the U.S. patent laws, including the changes implemented by the America Invents Act, and will survey the U.S. laws and policies for other forms of intellectual property protection, including trademark, copyright, and trade secrets. Second, the course will review the intellectual property laws in other countries and the process for obtaining patent protection internationally. Third, the course will introduce students to legal issues in licensing technology. Fourth, the course will cover other important areas of law that impact the development and management of technology such as product liability, antitrust, data security and privacy, and contracts. Graduate students also will conduct further research into an area of law covered by this course. After completion of this course, students should be able to understand the scope of and differences between the various forms of intellectual property protection; recognize potential legal issues relating to technology; understand the policy rationale for the various forms of intellectual property protection; understand how the various laws covered affect the development, commercialization, and management of technology; and gain insight into contract, tort, and antitrust laws as they apply to technology."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4650 - Internet Law (J. Brown)"},
{"paragraph": "This course emphasizes the impact of technology, here the Internet, on the development of the law and public policy. Topics covered include judicial jurisdiction over Internet disputes, intellectual property law such as copyright, trademark and patents, the constitutional and political implications of Internet taxation, First Amendment issues such as defamation and obscenity, Internet privacy, cybersecurity, and government regulation of the Internet including net neutrality.

{"paragraph": "PUBP 4725 - Information Security Policies (Mueller, Swire)\nThe security of cyberspace is one of the newest and most significant public policy challenges of the 21st century. As a policy domain, cybersecurity spans domestic and global perspectives and touches on national security and inter-state relations as well as the security of commercial transactions and end users. This course situates cybersecurity in the overall Internet ecosystem, examining it from the standpoint of private sector platform and network operators, end users, national governments, international institutions, and technical standards. Although the emphasis is on U.S. policy and law, it engages in comparisons and case analysis drawn from Europe and Asia. The course welcomes students from public administration, policy studies, communications and computer science. Students will be exposed to some basic technical material regarding the nature of the internet, cyberspace, vulnerabilities, exploits and incident response techniques and methods, but the course does not require advanced computer science expertise."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4726 - Privacy, Technology, Policy, and Law (Swire, Anton)\nThis course takes a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of privacy––a current topic of great international interest in for those in technology, policy, law, and/or business. The course is primarily lecture-based, with Socratic discussion of assigned readings, as well as active student participation via lively discussions and debates. Class sessions often include small-group, in-class activities to ensure hands-on experience in applying the concepts presented during lectures. There are no pre-requisites for this course, and students from varied backgrounds are welcome. Course topics include privacy engineering, big data, analytics, privacy policies, regulatory compliance, social networks, Internet of Things, behavioral advertising, ubiquitous computing, surveillance, wiretapping, and encryption. The course features group projects that engage students in real-world privacy challenges: specifically, compliance with new privacy regulations, development of an organization’s privacy and security policies, and development of new privacy-sensitive approaches and/or tools for Internet technologies. The professors draw on their extensive experience in business, government, technology, and law to address current privacy debates."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4803 - Game Theory (Marco)"},
{"paragraph": "This course is designed to introduce game theory to undergraduate students in public policy and related fields. It will also cover some elements of “public choice” or “positive political theory.” Game theory is now commonly used in economics, political science and other social sciences to model strategic interaction, (as opposed to unilateral decision-making and market interactions). Strategic interaction occurs if the best course of action depends on how others will react (and vice-versa):"},
{"paragraph": "Using game theory, we will investigation applications from economics, politics, public policy, and law. For the purposes of eligibility for the Law, Science, and Technology minor the course will cover the following issues:"},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4803 - Public Health Policy (Silver)"},
{"paragraph": "“Public health policies saved your life today and you didn’t even know it.” We’ll recall 2020 as the year the COVID-19 pandemic put an end to public health’s invisibility crisis. This course is not about the pandemic, per se, but will use it as a backdrop for exploring how the development, implementation, and success of health policies are shaped by factors that extend well beyond what the science and data suggest are “evidence-based” policy approaches. In this class, we’ll focus on COVID-19 and other contemporary examples to examine how science, social norms and values, political culture and ideology, and public and private institutions interact to create effective public health policies. Students will read policy articles and studies from peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Health Affairs), left- and right- leaning news outlets, and Tom Farley’s Saving Gotham. Students also will develop written assignments designed to provide you with polished products that may serve as future writing samples (e.g., for prospective employers)."},
{"paragraph": "About the instructor: Ms. Silver’s background in applied public health policy research, analysis and evaluation includes an emphasis on Medicare and Medicaid policy, patient safety and health care quality, public health infrastructure, chronic disease prevention and rural health.

The course explores similarities and differences between countries in terms of how they approach major social policy issues, and examines how different countries handle specific policy areas that are universally important in terms of social well-being and social welfare. The primary focus is on examination of policy differences in the U.S. and Western European/OECD countries in regard to major social welfare problems and policies including poverty, unemployment, child and family support, health care, retirement and disability, race and immigration, and incarceration."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4803 - Health Disparities (Persons)"},
{"paragraph": "This course examines the ways in which some of the most persistent manifestations of inequality in American society are captured in the presence of substantial differences in the susceptibility to disease, health outcomes, health status, and sometimes differences in medical treatment among Americans plays out with disproportionate variations along racial and ethnic lines. Hence, the course explores the social and structural determinants of health and resulting health inequalities."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4803 - Law, Medicine, & Ethics (Slieper)"},
{"paragraph": "This course will examine how law and ethics inform various areas of clinical medicine and healthcare. The course will take a particular look at various ethical frameworks and models for decision making, with an emphasis on the clinical application of ethics to assist in resolving ethical dilemmas and other ethically fraught situations that often arise in healthcare. From a legal perspective, the course will examine ways in which the law has responded to and offered guidance to ethical challenges in healthcare, with a critical eye towards whether or not the law “gets it right” in these situations. The course will also utilize role-playing exercises and simulations to help illuminate the application of these concepts in the clinical setting and to develop conflict resolution skills that can be applied in healthcare and beyond."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 4803 - Ethical/Societal Impacts of AI (Borenstein)\nThe aim of this course is to identify and discuss ethical issues emerging in relation to different types of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The primary approach will be to examine AI ethics through a series of case studies on topics such as bias, fairness, trust, and nudging."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 4803 - Data, Ethics, & Policy (Biddle)\nThis course will explore the ethical dimensions of data sciences and policies. Data sciences, and related fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), are transforming the world in which we live. They have the potential to bring tremendous benefits, but they also involve risks, including risks of privacy harms; human rights violations; social injustice and inequality; alienation, and others. In this course, we will examine conceptual tools and frameworks that deepen our understanding of the ethical issues associated with data sciences; we will probe these tools and frameworks in the context of current cases and challenges (including discussions of social media, bias, misinformation, surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and others), and we will explore policies and standards that help us to move forward and work toward achieving our shared ethical commitments."},
{"paragraph": "PHIL 4803 - Social Justice in the Digital Age (Hoffman)\nHow does the increasing digitization of almost everything affect the possibility of social justice? How can we develop the potential of digital technologies to reduce inequality and barriers to political and societal participation, and how should we react to possible threats posed by these technologies? In contrast to more theory-based courses, in this class working on social justice is driven by a concrete project on which small teams of students work throughout the semester. After brief introductions to working in teams and to several conceptualizations of social justice, student teams will work on one project—or a few shorter ones—so that additional research is determined by the problems they encounter. At the end, project results will be presented and discussed with the entire class."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4803 - Intellectual Property Transactions (Walsh)\nWe will explore Intellectual Property through a variety of business and technological scenarios. We will follow the life cycle of Intellectual Property from creation and development to licensing and sale, exploring the many commercial agreements and policy contexts that protect the associated Intellectual Property and govern the relationships of the companies and individuals engaging in these transactions. This course is ideal for future inventors, entrepreneurs, lawyers, policy analysts and business operators who need to understand the legal ramifications and pitfalls that one encounters in the creation and monetization of technology. The course also counts as one of the elective courses for the new GT Certificate in Intellectual Property."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4803 - Public Management (Kingsley)\nIn this course we explore the world of public management. The course involves considerable \"hands on\" experience with exploration of case studies and applied problem solving. Our objectives are threefold: understanding how public management systems are organized; examining modern practices of leadership and teamwork for public purposes; and exploring current proposals for reforming the public sector. In asking these questions we explore the management behaviors of public, non-profit, and for-profit organizations. Much of the class will focus on current case studies of issues in public management."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4803 - Cost Benefit Analysis (Massetti, Reeves)\nMassetti: This course provides an introduction to methods for Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). How much should governments spend in public health? How can NGOs prioritize investment in development projects? Should a city invest in better schools or in improving road conditions? What is the optimal balance of investments between climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation? These are policy questions that can be addressed using CBA. At the end of the semester students will be able to correctly frame a large variety of public policy and private investment problems using CBA. Students will be able to perform simple cost-benefit assessments of projects. Students will also be exposed to a critical assessment of CBA, using case studies, so that they can critically contribute to the public policy debate. The course is divided in three parts. The first part will introduce conceptual foundations of CBA. The second part will present the fundamentals of CBA (microeconomic foundation, discounting future costs and benefits, uncertainty, distributional issues, option price and existence value). The third part will cover methods to value impacts (observation, contingent valuation, shadow prices)."},
{"paragraph": "Reeves: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) provides a decision-making framework that is an important component of the policy analyst’s toolkit. The basic principle –implement policy with the greatest net benefits –is straightforward, yet some aspects of the application of CBA are the topic of ongoing discussion. Over the duration of this course, students will conduct a cost-benefit analysis while becoming familiar with and engaging in the discussion of key elements of CBA including standing, valuation, monetization, distributional impacts, and uncertainty & risk. In this course we approach CBA from the perspective of a policy analyst, framing CBA as a tool with roots in economics–but since economic principles undergird CBA, familiarity with microeconomics will be helpful."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4803 - Intergenerational Policy (Barke)"},
{"paragraph": "Political institutions and legal and regulatory frameworks are designed largely to maintain the status quo or make short-term incremental changes, falling short of the reach of many of today's real-world problems: years, decades, or longer. Policy models usually assume time horizons of an electoral term or a budget cycle. In this course we will look at the constitutional, legal, and ethical justifications and obstacles to long-term policy making. As we will examine, cognitive scientists have learned that people are not well-equipped for imagining future states beyond a decade or so, and economic tools such as CBA and discount rates have similar weaknesses. We will use case studies from regulatory and legislative decisions to understand whether our institutions can make policies for the long term. Student teams will take advantage of current resources and opportunities, and anticipate setbacks and pushback to do what Tech students are best at doing: find pragmatic solutions to significant problems. You will acquire perspectives and skills that are important for problem formulation, analysis for the long term, and strategic planning – all useful for work in business, law, and government."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4803 - Privacy, Technology, Policy, and Law (Anton, Swire)\nThis will course will enable students to understand how privacy is defined, protected, and managed in the areas of technology, policy, and law.

We will address the difference between innovation in policy design, and policy design to encourage technological innovation, both of which differently address enhanced accessibility and usability, and mitigation of barriers to the information technology use by people with disabilities and the aging in work, home, and daily living contexts."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4813 - Policy Implementation and Administration (Kingsley)\nThis course examines the implementation of public policy. It is a world inhabited by “principals” i.e., actors engaged in policy-making, “agents”, i.e., actors charged with turning a policy into functioning programs, and “target populations”, i.e., those that the policy is trying to affect. We take a practical managerial approach. First, there is a strong emphasis on understanding the types of organizations and institutions involved in the implementation of public policy. We examine a variety of governance models that link organizations together in an implementation process. Second, we will be exploring different tools used in the implementation of public policy. Students will study the practical challenges that arise from managing programs implemented using different policy tools, e.g., direct government, grants, loans, vouchers, regulation, insurance, to name but a few."},
{"paragraph": "PUBP 4843 – Intellectual Property Analytics (Marco)\nIntellectual property is an important part of the innovation system. The creation, processing, registration, and strategic use of IP have generated rich datasets. Academics have used these data to understand entrepreneurship, research and development, knowledge spillovers, and strategic behavior. Practitioners have developed methods to estimate brand value, returns to innovation, and emerging technological trends. Policy makers are interested in measuring patent quality and the impact of IP on the economy. In this course, we will learn traditional econometric uses of patent data and we will delve into more computationally intensive methods, such as natural language processing to analyze patent and trademark text. The course will combine reading and discussion of academic articles with labs and assignments where we will put to use the techniques employed in the readings. We will also explore some tools used in the field by practitioners for patent examination and technology landscaping. Required: At least one course in statistics. Recommended: Some programming experience."},

{"paragraph": "In their senior year, all students in the Bachelor of Science in Public Policy program enroll in a fall/spring capstone project sequence. In Policy Task Force, they apply the knowledge and skills from their core and elective courses, internships, and other experiences to address a current policy problem faced by a government agency, not-for-profit organization, or business firm. These organizations need real-time and expert analysis."},
{"paragraph": "Under the guidance of two faculty facilitators and occasional client input, and with advice as needed from the public policy faculty and others at Georgia Tech and beyond, the students prepare a detailed analysis of the client's problem; formulate alternative solutions; analyze their benefits, costs, and effectiveness; identify the most useful and practical approach; and prepare a professional written report and team presentation to the client. Projects such as this occasionally are conducted in graduate policy programs. The undergraduate program at Georgia Tech is unique in its approach to preparing students for professional jobs and graduate study with a senior-level project that, in many cases, has an actual impact in the policy arena."},

We do not move forward on committing to any clients without this brief proposal. Typically, we will provide feedback on the submission, and will let you know whether we can accept your proposal. Determinations are made based on skillsets of students, the feasibility of the project (generally and within the course constraints), and the clarity of the project goals."},

{"paragraph": "For MSPP, students are encouraged to pursue one or more concentrations.  A concentration consists of at least three 3-credit courses, of which at least one is the School of Public Policy.  Students can pursue concentrations within groups already developed by the faculty (see below). Or, students can pursue an individualized concentration, with the written approval of the proposed concentration program of study by their advisor. The School of Public Policy currently offers four areas of concentration: energy and environmental policy; information and communications policy; science and technology policy; and urban and regional development policy."},
{"paragraph": "You should quickly learn the particular strengths and interests of the School's faculty within each of these areas. However, like many of you, most faculty members have interests that overlap these areas of concentration or include policy areas that are not institutionalized here. The complexity of public policies encourages us to be flexible and creative in defining the boundaries of our interests. Thus, you should not feel compelled to choose only one of these areas of concentration, and you should permit your elective curriculum to evolve as you are exposed to new ideas by your courses, your fellow students, and the faculty. As the School develops, these concentrations may be changed or added to."},
{"paragraph": "The twin goals of environmental stewardship and energy sustainability provide our country and the world with two of the most pressing challenges of modern times. The overwhelming dependence of the world on fossil fuels has led to energy security, equity, and air and water quality problems in addition to the destabilizing effects of global climate change. Essentially all scientific leaders in the world now agree that the climate is changing and that our dependence on burning fossil fuels is the dominant cause."},
{"paragraph": "The environment and energy policy concentration at Georgia Tech's School of Public Policy positions graduates for leadership careers that address these challenges in various areas of professional life, including government agencies, universities, not-for-profits, and industry. Students with a focus on environment and energy policy will be introduced to such issues as environmental economics and regulation, energy and climate policy, as well as sustainability, institutions, and decision-making."},

{"paragraph": "Information and communication policies intersect with many dimensions of human existence and have a substantial impact on society.  Students learn the following:"},
{"paragraph": "Students develop an understanding of information and communications policy through a mix of theoretical and practical approaches.  Courses offer practical and theoretical readings, and the curriculum is enhanced because of the additional resources available in the Georgia Tech community. Students in this concentration typically have a range of backgrounds, such as computer science, electrical engineering, management, industrial engineering, public policy, and other disciplines that promote an exciting and interesting learning environment.  Several departments on the campus have relevant courses that are available to enrich the policy perspective.  Georgia Tech also has several active research centers that work in information and communications policy.  The Center for Advanced Communications Policy is also an important strategic partner of the School.  Georgia Tech is also home to GCATT (the Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology), which frequently hosts meetings with national and state industry and government leaders."},
{"paragraph": "Available with this track is a special emphasis on the Internet. As a new technology that is still in flux and that has wide social impacts, the Internet-related part of the track focuses on 1) the impacts of technology design and the policy role of the research community; 2) an international and supra-national perspective; and 3) institutional design and evolution. As a new technology, the Internet is not yet housed in a mature institution, and consequently, international political processes of institutional design are emphasized. The Internet and Public Policy Project (IP3) is a research and outreach organization within the School of Public Policy. IP3 provides opportunities to interact with policy-makers, conduct independent research, and connect with other researchers around the world. Students may select electives from the following public policy course list or they may consult with their advisor for courses offered across Georgia Tech:"},
{"paragraph": "Science and technology are central to the mission of the School of Public Policy at Georgia Tech. The School focuses on areas of public policy in which either the consequences of scientific and technological activity have public policy implications, or technical and scientific information is a significant input to the policy-making process. Within this broad school emphasis, the science and technology policy concentration addresses issues that either entail specific scientific or technological goals, such as the allocation of government resources in the advancement of science or, having more general purposes, contain scientific or technological activities at the core of their pursuit, such as economic competitiveness via high technology."},
{"paragraph": "This concentration offers students the opportunity to study how decision-making in a variety of contexts in the contemporary world has an impact on or is influenced by science and technology. This includes at least three aspects of the study of science and technology that are policy relevant."},
{"paragraph": "In sum, this concentration takes science and technology as key national assets and studies the ways in which they can be developed, employed, and assessed to serve the public interest.  Students may select electives from the following public policy course list or they may consult with their advisor for courses offered across Georgia Tech:"},
{"paragraph": "The policy analysis and policy evaluation concentration is designed to give students a strong analytic foundation in quantitative and economic approaches to the assessment of policy.  The focus on policy analysis provides students with skills in forecasting policy outcomes, valuation of policy impacts, and communicating policy alternatives to policymakers and citizens.  The focus on policy evaluation provides students with analytic skills needed for assessing outputs, outcomes, and impacts from policies.  Students In this track can draw from coursework offered in several schools including public policy, economics, industrial engineering, and city and regional planning.   Students in this track need to be mindful of pre-requisite courses in other schools and seek appropriate advice."},
{"paragraph": "Students in the public management concentration learn the leadership and decision-making skills needed in developing and managing organizations to be accountable and effective. These are challenging goals. To be accountable, managers must understand the scope of their authority, accept responsibility for their duties, and understand how to measure and report the fruits of their efforts in an open and transparent way. To be effective managers must know how to translate policy goals into management practices and measure whether their efforts are yielding the desired policy outcomes."},
{"paragraph": "In the current era, most public policies are implemented through complex networks of public programs that call upon the talents and resources of public, private, and not-for-profit organizations. These networks are bound together through contracts, funding mechanisms, and regulatory and reporting relationships. Being accountable and effective in the modern era means having a detailed understanding of how the different types of organizations and policy tools interact with one another."},
{"paragraph": "Students in the public management track can select from the following electives. However, students are also encouraged to explore related coursework from across the Georgia Tech campus."},

{"paragraph": "The Georgia Tech School of Public Policy ranks among top Graduate Programs in the U.S. News & World Report's 2021 rankings."},
{"paragraph": "The Georgia Tech School of Public Policy is internationally-recognized as a center of excellence in the analysis of the policy implications of science and technology.  The School has extensive international research, educational, and policy linkages with other organizations, centers, and programs around the world."},
{"paragraph": "Doctoral graduates from the School of Public Policy at Georgia Tech will find employment as university faculty and as senior research analysts in government and the private sector. Colleges and university faculty's demands for public policy Ph.D. graduates is much stronger (relative to supply) than most liberal arts degrees."},
{"paragraph": "The Ph.D. in Public Policy prepares students for advanced professional work or for academic careers. The doctorate degree is based on a core curriculum that stresses intellectual and methodological rigor, using the theories and applications of quantitative analysis; political, economic, and organizational analysis; research design and execution. This core is supplemented with in-depth study of particular substantive areas of public policy. The program focuses on just three substantive concentrations, each a particular strength of the School, and each closely related to Georgia Tech's focus on technology-intensive research and education. These focal areas include science and technology policy, environmental and energy policy, economic development policy, and information and communication technology policy."},
{"paragraph": "In any doctoral program the most important element is not strictly curricular in nature. Individual interaction between a graduate student and his or her thesis advisor remains the cornerstone of the Ph.D. educational process. A well-designed curriculum plays an important role in a student's education by providing depth and breadth in his or her chosen field of study and through interactions between students and faculty. However, the intensely inter-disciplinary nature of public policy makes it impossible to anticipate (or staff) all of the different methodological and substantive demands of a highly motivated and diverse group of students. Consequently, the program places great emphasis on mentoring. Upon admission, each student files a plan of study with their advisor and the School of Public Policy Graduate Committee. This plan includes a proposal for the student's major and minor areas of concentration. The curriculum is flexible enough to accommodate the interests of students in many policy areas. However, students generally focus on one or more of the following as a major area of concentration: environmental policy, science and technology policy, urban and economic development policy, information technology and communications policy, or an individualized program of study. Each concentration has a capstone seminar at the Ph.D. level that majors are required to complete. The minor concentration is an area of study that is distinct from the major and taken with different professors. However, in most instances the major will consist of four classes and the minor will consist of three classes."},

{"paragraph": "In the new millennium, science and technology (S&T) suffuse and connect the everyday lives of people across the globe as never before. Along with the depth of S&T’s global impact on everyday life, the shifting global landscape of S&T, and with it rising global competition and tensions, are also strikingly evident. This course, which draws on a range of histories and sociologies of S&T, has two broad goals: First, to explore the global and transnational landscape of S&T. Second, to critically investigate the impact of shifting international landscape of S&T and whether and how West-centric historiographies and sociologies of S&T continue to influence techno-scientific practices of the present. For example, does the diffusion theory of science and technology fold the descriptions and analyses of the shifting global contours of S&T into a West-centric imaginary. And, if this is so, how do we reorient our imaginaries and practices to better understand and explain not just the circulations of S&T at present, but also the erased connected histories that cut across commonly accepted borders of the nation and/or west/non-west."},

{"paragraph": "Course description: It’s obvious that today our lives, societies, and even our planet are shaped by computer technologies. But how exactly did we get here? And what effects has the ever-increasing capacity of these technologies—and our ever-increasing dependence on them—had for individuals, communities, nations, and the environment? This graduate seminar will explore answers to these questions through the history of computer and information technologies. Through the study of how contemporary computing capacities came to be, we will understand better the contested pathways and politics of technical innovations; the effects of escalating computing power on gender, race, and labor relations; the social and environmental footprint of digital infrastructures; and the many meanings ascribed to computers over time and across borders."},
{"paragraph": "Who this class is for: Graduate students in the humanities and social sciences who are interested in the history, sociology, and anthropology of science and technology; graduate students in public policy and international affairs who want to think about the role of digital technologies in shaping politics and economics at different scales; and graduate students in computer science and engineering who design and build computer and information technologies and wish to take a holistic perspective on their work and its broader impacts."},

{"paragraph": "The Meg & Sam Flax Lecture Series invites top scholars, policymakers, and practitioners to speak to a wide audience of Georgia Tech students and faculty on issues of urgent importance in public policy. Our goal is not just a better understanding of current issues, but to get diverse perspectives on the proper role(s) of government in solving crucial problems. Because they practice at the cutting edge of their fields, or on the front lines of government policy, the Flax Lecturers speak not from philosophy or theory, but from facts, data, and experience. Topics range from science & technology policy to energy and the environment, from pandemic threats to sustainable development, from artificial intelligence and cyber-security to monetary policy, and even outer space. All Flax lectures are free of charge. Members of the broader Georgia Tech and Atlanta community are welcome to attend. Started in the Fall of 2019, the series is still ongoing."},

{"paragraph": "Societies around the world seek to ensure that science and technology continue to provide solutions to social, economic, health, and environmental challenges while minimizing potential risks. The science & technology (S&T) policy concentration at Georgia Tech's School of Public Policy offers students the opportunity to learn how this is done. Students will study how countries around the world build and sustain a highly skilled technical workforce, maintain a vital research and development enterprise, facilitate the translation of research into commercial realities, and incorporate public views into decisions around innovation and regulation.\nThe context for research and innovation is ever changing, with shifts in social, demographic, and economic structures, rapid technological development, increased globalization of S&T, greater environmental concerns, and ongoing debate about the best way to achieve society's overall goals. This is a dynamic area of study, and the professors at Georgia Tech, through their strong research profile, are key players in defining the future of the scholarly field and advising agencies and organizations on their policies. To further advance the field, every two years we convene leading scholars from around the world to explore the research frontier together and debate current issues at our Atlanta S&T Policy Conference. Our students participate in the discussion. We are also engaged with colleagues and organizations around the nation and world, providing our students opportunities to work on nationally and globally oriented research projects and to spend semesters abroad studying S&T policy, particularly in European countries."},

{"paragraph": "The twin goals of environmental stewardship and energy sustainability provide our country and the world with two of the most pressing challenges of modern times. The overwhelming dependence of the world on fossil fuels has led to energy security, equity, and air and water quality problems in addition to the destabilizing effects of global climate change. Essentially all scientific leaders in the world now agree that the climate is changing and that our dependence on burning fossil fuels is the dominant cause."},
{"paragraph": "It can be argued that society has many of the technologies it needs to meet environmental and energy challenges, but better public policy is crucial to ensuring their adoption and widespread use. Through case studies and economic analysis, this focus area illustrates the value of designing policy mechanisms that match the socio-technical nature of the barriers facing cleaner systems and technologies. Since many energy and climate-related decisions are fraught with deep uncertainties, it is not sufficient to evaluate static policy interventions. New knowledge about environmental conditions, energy resources, technologies and social systems need to be iteratively assimilated into governance approaches."},
{"paragraph": "Principles of participatory democracy and conflict resolution are also taught as important features of effective environmental and energy policy. While intervention by governments is important, it is often much more effective when implemented at a variety of scales in cooperation with a plurality of actors, in partnership with stakeholder groups, cities, and corporations."},

{"paragraph": "What determines the supply of people trained in science and technology? We study the public policies and social systems associated with education, training, and professional development in scientific and technology fields and professions. This begins with understanding early exposure to the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields in the K-12 education systems and extends through career trajectories."},

Science and innovation are more likely to advance if the full-range of humanity brings their unique perspectives to the enterprise. Yet too often policy and social barriers hinder the participation of women and disadvantaged populations in pursuing scientific and technological careers. We explore policies and management strategies to reduce these barriers, as well as prospects and challenges in designing and implementing them."},

{"paragraph": "Philosophy is a tradition of critical inquiry that complements what other disciplines study.  It often seeks to address fundamental questions that underlie other disciplines. For example, philosophers ask: What is the nature of knowledge? What are the conditions of the possibility of knowledge? What are the various methods used in the development of scientific knowledge, and how to they relate to one another? Philosophers also discuss the nature of human values, the question of how ethical decisions can be justified, and what characterizes a good life, a good person, well-designed technology, and a well-ordered society. The School provides a context in which such questions can be integrated into broader deliberations concerning science, technology, the environment, and public policy."},
{"paragraph": "In the School of Public Policy, research related to philosophy covers the following areas:"},
{"paragraph": "Ethics: matters of value and obligation, as they are relevant for engineering ethics, environmental ethics, bioethics, responsible innovation, and research ethics (Kirkman, Berry, Borenstein, Levine, Biddle)"},
{"paragraph": "Ethics and philosophy of science and technology: the role of value judgments—particularly ethical value judgments—in science and technology; pragmatism (Biddle, Rosenberger, Rogers)"},
{"paragraph": "Ethics education: Problem based learning; self-directed learning; learning technologies; assessment of learning (Berry, Kirkman, Hoffmann, Borenstein)"},
{"paragraph": "Political philosophy: participatory democracy; deliberative democracy; justice and design; institutional design (Hoffmann, Kirkman, Rosenberger, Klein)"},
{"paragraph": "Wicked problems and conflicts: framing and the perception of reality; biases and cognitive overload; values realized by specific policy implementations and how we assess these; and stakeholder analysis (Hoffmann, Berry, Kirkman, Rogers, Biddle)"},
{"paragraph": "Epistemology and philosophy of science: the conditions under which knowledge, including scientific knowledge, are developed, with a particular focus on how knowledge claims should be justified; philosophical problems posed by evaluation of research in particular and of policy generally (Biddle, Hoffmann, Rogers)"},
{"paragraph": "Phenomenology: the philosophy of user experience; laboratory instrumentation interpretation practices; the analysis of everyday technologies (Rosenberger)"},
{"paragraph": "Reasoning, argument, deliberation, and problem solving: argument visualization; diagrammatic and model-based reasoning; systems thinking and spatial scaling; conceptual change in science and science education; logic and critical thinking (Hoffmann, Rogers, Kirkman)"},
{"paragraph": "Philosophy of Technology: justice and design; ethics of emerging technologies; values embedded in technologies (Rosenberger, Borenstein, Hoffmann, Berry, Kirkman, Levine, Klein, Biddle)"},
{"paragraph": "Semiotics (theory of representation) (Hoffmann)"},

{"paragraph": "Students in the public management concentration learn the leadership and decision-making skills needed in developing and managing systems for implementing public policy that are accountable and effective. These are challenging goals. To be accountable, managers must understand the scope of their authority, accept responsibility for their duties, and understand how to measure and report the fruits of their efforts in an open and transparent way. To be effective, managers must know how to translate policy goals into strategic priorities for their organization and management practices that measure whether their efforts are yielding the desired policy outcomes."},
{"paragraph": "In the current era, most public policies are implemented through complex networks of public programs that call upon the talents and resources of public, private, and not-for-profit organizations. These networks are bound together through contracts, funding mechanisms, regulatory and reporting relationships.  An accountable and effective manager in the modern era must have a detailed understanding of how different types of organizations and policy tools interact with one another.  The public management concentration is designed to provide students the perspective to be effective managers whether working for a public, private, or not-for-profit organization."},
{"paragraph": "The public management concentration builds upon a solid foundation of courses required in the core classes of the School of Public Policy.  At the graduate level, students are required to take one of three courses related to public management: organization theory, public management, or policy implementation. In addition, students can draw upon the following courses to build a concentration:"},

{"paragraph": "Public policy researchers and students recognize that solutions to society’s problems must be approved by relevant decision makers. These policy actors can be in legislatures, executive branches, or the courts; they often are located inside regulatory and administrative agencies; they often involve a combination of local, state, national, and international actors; and they might be energized members of the public or experts in science, technology, or other fields."},
{"paragraph": "The study of public policy is fundamentally multidisciplinary because policy problems have economic, ethical, political, legal, and often scientific and technological dimensions. Even the most scientifically logical and technologically efficient answer to a policy problem – such as nuclear waste storage, genetic therapy, smart grid monitoring, urban recycling, or internet regulation – will fail if it ignores constitutional and statutory law, administrative and judicial procedures, the inclusion of relevant stakeholders, and the political ideals and goals of diverse participants."},
{"paragraph": "Recognizing this, much of the research and teaching in Georgia Tech’s School of Public Policy focuses on the “how” of public policy: expertise and public input; legislative, regulatory, and administrative processes; stakeholder and interest group participation; constitutional issues; judicial processes; and legal practice. And because most policy problems have causes and cures at a variety of spatial scales, we examine decision-making behavior at the city, regional, national, and global levels. Students, faculty, and alumni of the School are able to navigate the analysis, selection, and implementation of decisions in business, the non-profit sector, and government with innovative perspectives and a wide array of tools and skills."},
{"paragraph": "Public Policy provides a good background for the study of law. Students interested in law can earn the Law, Science, and Technology minor or the pre-law certificate in preparation for law school and a career in law. Students enrolled in other majors are also invited to participate in this minor or certificate program."},

Our ability to cope with wicked problems—and with the conflicts they usually create—is crucial for consensus building in the political and corporate world, and for any task that requires collaboration among people with different backgrounds. Reflect! can be used in problem-based learning projects (especially in ethics and social science education), by teams of professionals, and by stakeholders in controversies—both in face-to-face deliberation and online."},

{"paragraph": "Many funding agencies require the sharing and preservation of research data. In addition to meeting funder requirements, sharing your data increases the potential for research impact. Review the Registry of Research Data Repositories to determine whether an appropriate discipline repository is available to you, or submit your research to the Georgia Tech Digital Repository."},

{"paragraph": "Georgia Tech Open Access Policy"},
{"paragraph": "Upload your scholarly work to the repository"},
{"paragraph": "Open Access means making the peer-reviewed scholarly work you produce accessible and with no charge to the public, and ideally with as few re-use restrictions as possible. There are several reasons Georgia Tech passed the Georgia Tech Open Access Policy."},
{"paragraph": "Faculty can use this policy to make their work openly available, no matter where they publish."},
{"paragraph": "Find out how you can submit your work, or waive the policy."},
{"paragraph": "Georgia Tech faculty are committed to making their work discoverable and making sure it has the most impact possible in research and scholarship. Making your research articles openly accessible means that anyone with an internet connection can have access to your important work, not just those with a paid subscription to an online site."},
{"paragraph": "In 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) released a memorandum requiring all US Government agencies that fund research to create and implement plans to make the products of that funded research open access -without embargo. This memo further updates a 2013 OSTP memo which was more limited in scope. The open access advocacy organization SPARC has set up a useful comparison database of federal agency sharing requirements."},
{"paragraph": "An important component of open access is understanding that authors have rights to the work that they produce, and should retain them when possible. In the US, authors automatically have copyright to original work they produce, but often a publisher will require that an author transfer copyright to the publishing organization. This leaves the publisher in charge of how that article will be disseminated or distributed."},
{"paragraph": "Addenda: An agreement with a publisher is a contract, and contracts can be amended. Some great tools for helping you generate publishing contact addenda arethe SPARC addendum, or the Creative Commons addendum engine."},
{"paragraph": "Know what rights you retain: If you transfer your copyright to a publisher, read your agreement carefully to find out what rights as an author you retain. In many cases, publishers that request copyright transfer grant back some rights of distribution to the author. If you would like a right that you don’t see in your publishing agreement, ask for it. A great tool for finding out standard rights retention for journal titles is Sherpa Romeo."},
{"paragraph": "Publish in an open access journal: Check the https://doaj.org/ for open access journals in your field. Open access journals are widely available, and most publishers and professional societies publish open access titles. Usually Open Access journals will ask you to assign your work a Creative Commons license. A Creative Commons license will allow free reuse of your work while assuring attribution."},
{"paragraph": "Publish in a hybrid journal: A so-called “hybrid” open access journal is a typical subscription based journal that will also publish peer reviewed open access journals for an author fee. Most of the large commercial publishers have hybrid journal titles."},
{"paragraph": "How does the OA Policy help preserve my author rights?"},
{"paragraph": "Per the GT Open Access policy, faculty can submit a peer-reviewed author manuscript version (sometimes called a “post print”) of their own scholarly articles to the GT Digital Repository, the library’s institutional repository. You can submit via the repository submission form, or contact the repository team with any questions."},
{"paragraph": "Why do we have/need an open access policy?\nUnder the traditional publishing model, most authors transfer copyright to the publisher, leaving no rights retained by authors to share their work freely, online, as they choose. Publishers use these copyrights to charge for access to the final, published work. Publishers can also use their held copyright to prohibit authors from making their own work available for no charge in an institutional repository such as the GT Digital Repository. Under the Open Access Policy, a Faculty member may deposit a ‘post-print’ of his/her scholarly article into the GT Digital Repository."},
{"paragraph": "What is a post-print?  \nThe term ‘post-print’ refers to the author’s manuscript version that has been peer reviewed and revised, but without the publisher’s formatting, layout, and typefacing applied."},
{"paragraph": "Is Georgia Tech claiming copyright ownership of what I write?\nNot at all. The policy grants Georgia Tech only the right to make the post-print of your article accessible via the GT Digital Repository (or a similar repository). You keep your copyright until such time as you sign it over to a publisher."},
{"paragraph": "If I decide to sign my copyright over to a publisher, do I then have to take my paper out of the GT Digital Repository (or other repository)?\nNot necessarily. Even if you sign over exclusive rights to a publisher, many publishers still allow archiving of the author's peer-reviewed manuscript version. Check your publisher's policies before signing. You can also amend an agreement to let publishers know you wish to put a manuscript version in a repository (contact us for more information about this). Read any agreement with a publisher carefully before signing in order to be fully aware of the rights you are signing away."},
{"paragraph": "What kinds of publications are included in this policy?  \nThis policy applies to all published scholarly articles that any person authors or coauthors while appointed as a member of the Faculty, except for any such articles authored or co-authored before the adoption of this policy, or subject to a conflicting agreement formed before the adoption of this policy, or conducted under a classified research agreement. Examples of excluded content include books, course materials, theses, student-only publications, opinion pieces."},
{"paragraph": "What universities have tried open access policies and what good has come to them from it?  \nYou can find a list of institutions and funders with open access policies here: http://roarmap.eprints.org/. One form of desired “good” might be increased distribution and citation to work. Studies have found that publications available via open access experience more downloads than those available by subscription only. There are conflicting results regarding whether publications available by open access experience more citations, though most studies find an increase in citations. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access for more information."},
{"paragraph": "Will Georgia Techʼs policy force compliance in a manner conflicting with my funding sources or with the policies of the journals in which I want to publish?  \nNo. In fact, funding sources are increasingly requiring that publications resulting from research grants be made freely and openly accessible. The NIH has had a policy in place for several years, and the Department of Energy implemented a policy in October of 2014. However, the policy will not require you to take action that conflicts with funding sources or journal policies, because you can opt out. The policy makes it possible for you to retain rights, if you choose to do so and if that choice is compatible with your funding sources and journal policies."},
{"paragraph": "Why do we not make open access opt in?  \nOpt in approaches, also called recommendations, do not have the influence over publisher policies that opt out approaches have. A number of publishers have policies that allow archiving “if required by employer/funding agency”. A Georgia Tech policy with opt out will allow authors to fall under the “if” condition.  Further, because this is an official policy applying to all faculty, a publisher cannot say that the policy does not apply. By virtue of being a Georgia Tech faculty member, the policy applies. The publisher may request that you opt out, which you are free to do if you wish."},
{"paragraph": "Does passing an open access policy mean that Georgia Tech will require/encourage us to publish in open access journals?  \nNo. The policy neither encourages nor discourages publication in any venue type. Faculty should publish in the venues that are most appropriate for their work."},
{"paragraph": "Did Georgia Tech adopt this policy to harm publishers?  \nNo. The goals of this policy are the dissemination of Georgia Tech’s scholarly work, and proactively preparing us for coming federal guidelines for public access to research. We expect scholarly publishers, whatever their business model, are also preparing for the increased requirements for scholarly work to be made open access."},
{"paragraph": "Why should Georgia Tech stick its neck out?  \nThe policy gives authors who are so inclined a chance to increase the distribution and possibly impact of their work by making it more widely available. Changes in publishing are a reality and will continue to be so. Establishing a policy that works for Georgia Tech on our terms means we have a chance to lead in any system-wide policy discussions that may take place later."},
{"paragraph": "What do I have to do if/when I donʼt want to participate in the policy for a given article?  \nThe policy asks that you opt out. The library maintains a simple web-based form to allow you to do that, but the library does not enforce compliance with the policy."},
{"paragraph": "What do I have to do if my publisher does not wish for me to comply with the Open Access Policy?  \nCompliance is your decision. The publisher can request that you get a waiver for the policy, which is automatically granted to you with no questions asked."},

For works created anonymously or for hire, protection lasts 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever is shorter."},
{"paragraph": "What does this mean? If you write an original story, record an original song, take an original photograph – the copyright belongs to you under US copyright law. You get to decide how to share it, whether to sell it or not, or whether to transfer those rights to another entity or individual."},
{"paragraph": "Making sure your usage of others' copyrighted work does not infringe upon their legal rights can be a daunting process. First, you need to determine whether the work you intend to use is copyrighted. Second, if the work is copyrighted, do you need to get permission? Third, how would you go about getting such permission from the copyright holder? No permission is needed if your intended us falls under one of the copyright exceptions including fair use."},
{"paragraph": "Copyright is a form of protection for “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.”This means the work must be original and must exist in some physical form. And digital products and files count as physical forms under the law. No registration or copyright notice is required."},
{"paragraph": "Any work published prior to 1927* is in the public domain, meaning that no one owns the copyright on it, it is literally in the domain of the public. That means that users of material in the public domain to not have to ask for permission to re-use a work."},
{"paragraph": "For works published between 1927 and 1963, the copyright must have been renewed in order to be protected for 95 years from date of publication. If it was not renewed, the work is now in the public domain. Additionally, if the author deems the work public domain, it will exist as such."},
{"paragraph": "*this cutoff year will increase by one every January 1 for the next 50 years."},

Fair use allows for the use of copyrighted work that is owned by another person or entity without having to get permission of the copyright owner. Fair use is a defense, not a right, and someone who is accused of infringement of copyright cannot automatically escape legal action by claiming “fair use”. Under US copyright law, there are four-factors of analysis to determine whether a use of copyrighted work was “fair use” .These factors are:"},
{"paragraph": "For more information, see the University System of Georgia’s Fair Use Checklist or check the U.S. Copyright Office’s Fair Use Index to determine if your desired use of a copyrighted material is “fair use”.

{"paragraph": "Ramifications for copyright infringement can include criminal or civil legal action from the copyright holder, plus consequences from violation of the Georgia Tech Student Honor Code, IP policy, and work rules."},
{"paragraph": "Until recently, most copyright cases had to be decided in federal court. However, The Copyright Claims Board (CCB) was established by law in 2020, to begin reviewing claims in 2022. The purpose of the CCB is to allow copyright holders to bring small infringement claims without having to go to federal court. It is relatively inexpensive to file a claim via the CCB, as opposed to the much greater expense of filing in federal court. Infringement claims brought to the CCB have an award cap at a maximum of $15,000 per infringement, or $30,000 total. You can find out more about the CCB here: https://ccb.gov/faq/"},
{"paragraph": "The following is informational only and does not constitute legal advice."},
{"paragraph": "What if I receive a claim notice from the CCB?\nIf you receive a notice of an infringement claim from the CCB, it does not necessarily mean that you have committed an infringement. It means that someone is claiming that you have infringed their copyright. There are many legally protected ways to reuse copyrighted material in copyright law, including many exceptions for teaching, research, and educational purposes."},
{"paragraph": "Initial notices of infringement claims will be delivered in Georgia in person. They will not come via email. Subsequent claim reminders may come via email."},

{"paragraph": "Persons who receive a claim notice from the CCB have two options.\nOption 1) Respond (in writing or via the online form) within 60 days by agreeing to participate in the CCB's proceedings. In this case a board of three copyright officers, appointed by the Librarian of Congress, will hear the case. Cases are heard remotely online. Attorneys are not required, but are allowed."},
{"paragraph": "Option 2) Opt out of having your case heard by the CCB. You have 60 days to choose to opt out of participating in the CCB process. If you choose to opt out, there are no penalties. The person bringing the claim against you would have to file a claim in federal court instead if they want to continue to take action against you."},
{"paragraph": "Please note, if you ignore the notice, your claim will proceed in the CCB process, and the CCB will determine the outcome. The CCB could deliver a default award which you would be bound to comply with."},

Many students have no choice but to forgo buying their course materials despite fears of how it will impact their performance.

{"paragraph": "Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules about quantity of use in fair use. The only way Fair Use can be officially determined is in Federal Court. Should you need to make a fair use determination, the fair use checklist developed by the USG Board of Regents can help. The site also indicates that “complete and retain a copy of this checklist for each ‘fair use’ of a copyrighted work in order to establish a ‘reasonable and good faith’ attempt at applying fair use should any dispute regarding such use arise.”"},

{"paragraph": "Content Modes"},
{"paragraph": "Helpful Resources & FAQ"},
{"paragraph": "What is the Media Bridge?"},
{"paragraph": "The Media Bridge is a large-scale digital screen, imagined as a “pool” that is “fed” by streams descending the facade of the bridge, joining the Price Gilbert and Crosland library buildings."},
{"paragraph": "The physical and digital design of the Bridge media is intended to create for the Library an outward-facing public “discovery” venue, showcasing Georgia Tech’s culture of research, scholarship, and creativity."},
{"paragraph": "To that end, the Media Bridge environment is used to its best advantage in showcasing short, visually compelling motion graphics that may lead to epiphanies discovery of Georgia Tech resources - including people, places, and ideas."},
{"paragraph": "Where is the Media Bridge located?"},
{"paragraph": "The Media Bridge spans the space between Crosland Tower and Price Gilbert Memorial Library. It is visible from both sides but “fronts” Cherry Street."},
{"paragraph": "Who is eligible to work with the Media Bridge?"},
{"paragraph": "The Media Bridge is open for collaboration with Georgia Tech students, faculty, and staff. Visiting artists and scholars are also welcome to collaborate on pieces for Media Bridge."},
{"paragraph": "How long does it take for my work to show up on the Media Bridge?"},
{"paragraph": "In short, it depends on the work you produce. Because of the specialized nature of the nine-screen system, all videos must be placed into an After Effects template and rendered at 60 frames per second. So, if you provide a 3072 X 1280 .mp4 that simply needs to be placed on the “pool” portion, the piece can be turned around with essentially only rendering time. If you provide images or work that must be animated, it will take longer. Consultation with Library experts will determine an approximate timeline."},
{"paragraph": "Why is After Effects used to create videos for the Media Bridge?"},
{"paragraph": "The Media Bridge currently uses a Brightsign player and the campus standard 22 Mile Digital Content Management System to display .mp4 files across nine screens. In order to achieve this effect, any content must be placed into a specialized After Effects template that allows those nine screens to work together across a timeline."},
{"paragraph": "Is there an alternative software I could use to create videos for the Media Bridge?"},
{"paragraph": "In cases where the user desires more interactivity, a media server is also present. This requires custom coding or motion graphics work to express images and text across nine screens, plus some periphery or web-based tools for interactivity."},
{"paragraph": "Can I add music or sound effects to my work for the Media Bridge?"},
{"paragraph": "Yes, the Media Bridge supports sound. It doesn’t run with sound 24 hours a day out of respect for surrounding buildings. However, for special presentations, the sound is available on-site."},
{"paragraph": "How do I submit my work for the Media Bridge?"},
{"paragraph": "Requests can be made here."},
{"paragraph": "What if I need to change or cancel my request for the Media Bridge?"},
{"paragraph": "Simply e-mail Library Communications Manager II, Jason Wright at: jason.wright@gatech.edu to change or cancel your Media Bridge request."},

When the dissertation is approved by the graduate office, and the student has graduated, the dissertation along with supplemental files will be imported into SMARTech."},
{"paragraph": "Why would I want my dissertation defense recording in the GT Digital Repository? \nThe GT Digital Repository allows users to upload research and scholarship that will be digitally preserved with a stable link for years to come. Georgia Tech graduate students have made major contributions to academic fields, cities, and industries through their dissertation research. The Georgia Tech Library wants to capture that research, make it accessible, and preserve it for future scholars to build upon."},
